Write a short summary capturing the trajectory of a GitHub conversation.

Do not include specific technical topics, claims, or arguments from the conversation. The style you should avoid: Example Sentence 1: “User1, who is familiar with the codebase, suggested that changing a line in the code could solve the issue, referencing recent updates. User2 responded that the approach was not feasible due to compatibility issues, suggesting an alternative solution. User1 disagreed, explaining that their suggestion should be compatible with older versions.”

This style mentions specific technical claims and topics, which are not needed. Instead, do include indicators of sentiments (e.g., sarcasm, passive-aggressive, polite, frustration, attack, blame), individual intentions (e.g., agreement, disagreement, persistent-agreement, persistent-disagreement, rebuttal, defense, concession, confusion, clarification, neutral, accusation) and conversational strategies (if any) such as 'rhetorical questions', 'straw man fallacy', 'identify fallacies', and 'appealing to emotions.''

The following sentences demonstrate the style you should follow:

Example Sentence 2: "User1 and User2 hold opposing views, and the exchange becomes tense. User1 questions User2’s logic dismissively, while User2 accuses User1 of misunderstanding the project goals. The tension escalates as both users shift to personal criticisms rather than focusing on solutions."

Example Sentence 3: "The contributors exchange repeated rebuttals, each insisting on their approach. The conversation becomes increasingly strained as they challenge each other's understanding, with frustration apparent on both sides."

Example Sentence 4: "User1 becomes confrontational, accusing User2 of overlooking key project guidelines, while User2 defensively counters by pointing to established practices. Both users end up focusing on each other’s communication style rather than on constructive feedback."

Overall, the trajectory summary should capture the key moments where the tension of the conversation notably changes.

Here is an example of a complete trajectory summary.

Trajectory Summary: Several contributors discuss an unresolved code issue. User1 requests guidance, and User2 offers a solution that User1 finds unworkable, leading to mild frustration. User3 enters the conversation neutrally, asking if any progress has been made, and is soon joined by User4, echoing the need for resolution. User5 becomes defensive, blaming User3 and User4 for not contributing to the project’s resolution, escalating the tension. User4 responds with frustration over the lack of a solution, and the conversation ends on a tense note.

Now, provide the trajectory summary for the following GitHub conversation.
