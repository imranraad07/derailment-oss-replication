Feature Request: xBR shader and xBRZ filter for GSDX in both PS2 and PSX mode.,ghost,30381958,1,30381958,0,"Could you please implement  xBR shader or xBRZ filter or both in GSDX plugin. It would be very beneficial for both PS2 and PSX 2D and sprite-based games.
xBR and xBRZ are pixel art scaling algorithms ,they give best results in 2D/sprite based games with low resolution textures and games with pre-rendered backgrounds which dont upscale well with higher internal resolutions but they also give good results in 3D games.  xBR/xBRZ are already used with good results in emulators like Retroarch , Higan, Desmume and PPSSPP.

steps can be taken to overcome the daunting issue of line speed != line

Vagrant box downloads extremely slow,briancline,57258770,23,208706127,0,"I just tried asking Vagrant to download ubuntu/trusty64, and was getting speeds of <= 5 KiB/sec. I killed it and tried again using the exact same command, and got 29 MiB/sec. 

I think @mitchellh is correct in that this doesn't really seem like a Vagrant issue. If anything, it seems more like an Atlas issue (so possibly the ELB and/or whatever's sitting behind it). I highly doubt it has anything to do with the routes or hops between end-users and the ELB VIPs -- you wouldn't typically see such a polarizing set of speeds in that case, especially considering both VIPs terminate in us-east-1.

If for no other reason, it'd be highly desirable to see these made available through a CDN rather than a centrally-located ELB. Then again, I'm just one guy (who isn't paying for this service), so take that for what it's worth. Pretty thankful it's there either way.

As shown above, this isn't enough for .lnk files. Windows hides the .lnk extension. If you usually use smaller thumbnails, the minuscule difference in the icon is barely visible.

Also, it is arguably because torrent clients aren't smart that these types of malicious torrents are still going around, and that's why I think qBittorrent should provide this feature.

IMHO certain extensions should also be skipped by default, for the same reason. It would be a great security and usability improvement.

""Malicious users are taking advantage of distracted/careless users"" would be a more accurate statement. Do you think the possibility of receiving phishing emails is a flaw of E-mail? If so, is the possibility of hearing the voice of a scammer in real life, believing what they say, and giving them money, a flaw of your ears? Should your auditory system should autoblock certain words/sentences on its own? Perhaps it should be the brain acting on the information instead.

Furthermore, the greater issue of downloading these kinds of torrents should not be underestimated. You have to go out of your way, even when searching for illegal content, to find these kinds of torrents. And no, the `.exe` in RARBG torrents does not count as an example of this practice in a popular site; it is actually just a harmless text file with the `.exe` extension designed to prevent mirroring  by software that, ironically, relies on ""file extensions"" to make assumptions about their content.

Not to mention that if anyone actually accidentally clicks a dangerous exe, it should be caught by UAC anyway.

DDC-3730: Embeddable hydrates to object instead of null,doctrinebot,120671163,1,120671163,0,"Jira issue originally created by user pcnc:

Good afternoon,

When hydrating an Embeddable with nullable attributes the result is an instance of the Embeddable class , this is obviously correct and expected behavior. 

If all the attributes are null the hydrator will still return an instance of the class with all of its properties null , even if I persist and flush my Entity with the Embeddable being set as null . 

For clarification :

```

class MyEntity
{
    protected $myEmbeddable;

    public function setMyEmbeddable(MyEmbeddable $myEmbeddable = null)
    {
        $this->myEmbeddable = $myEmbeddable;
    }
    [...]
}

$newEntity = new MyEntity();
$newEntity->setMyEmbeddable(null);

$em->persist($newEntity);
$em->flsuh($newEntity);

```

Calling $newEntity->getMyEmbeddable() will return an instance of the MyEmbeddable object with all of it's attributes set to null .

I expected $newEntity->getMyEmbeddable() to be NULL . 

Can someone clarify is this is expected behaviour ? In case it is , how can I achieve what I'm looking for ?

Do you mean lifecycle callbacks — maybe `postLoad` — as shown in 
http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/events.html#lifecycle-callbacks? 
Looks like those only work on entities, not value objects, as far as I 
can see? Eg. if I used `postLoad` an embeddable will already have been 
hydrated with invalid data (if the data in the database is all `null`, 
for example). Alternatively, if I move the VO properties onto the entity 
directly I’ve lost the nice encapsulation that embeddable so usefully 
provides (eg. if I had a `Product` entity with a `SalePrice` with 2 
properties, `value` and `currency` I’d have to move those 2 properties 
onto the entity. Whilst I could then have those properties be private 
and do an `is_null` check for those 2 properties before instantiating 
and returning the VO from `getSalePrice() : SalePrice { … }` it does 
rather compromise my entity.

I’m almost certainly missing something here, sorry. Rather new to 
Doctrine so still learning!

OK, gotcha.

So in the example I gave — a `Product` entity which wants to use a `SalePrice` VO with 2 fields, `amount` and `currency` — would you suggest simply putting a `sale_price_amount` and `sale_price_currency` property on the `Product` entity, make those private, and then have `Product::getSalePrice() : SalePrice` first check whether the 2 properties are `null` before attempting to instantiate and return the VO?

If so, that seems workable and means the entity is responsible for checking if the VO should be instantiated (rather than having the VO able to be ‘invalid’ and have to implement an `isValid()` method).

Example code of what I mean:

``` php
    class Product
    {
        private $sale_price_amount;
        private $sale_price_currency;

        public getSalePrice() : SalePrice
        {
            if (
                is_null($this->sale_price_currency) || 
                is_null($this->sale_price_amount)
            ) {
                return null;
            }

            return new SalePrice(
                $this->sale_price_currency, 
                $this->sale_price_amount
            );
        }

Correct.

Basically, since this is a scenario that Doctrine can't cover right now (because of how RDBMS DDL works), you can just implement it in userland for the few times where it pops up.

I suppose the major downside of your approach is that you do still have a VO in an inconsistent state, whereas if you don't let Doctrine hydrate the VO as an embeddable you avoid this; a bit more boilerplate & checking code, but you never have a VO in an invalid state.

Really it's just a trade-off between the 2 options. Others reading this should just be aware of the 2 options and their various merits.

My 2 cents on the sensitive subject of  nullable embedded properties:

- when the Embeddable has at least one non-nullable `@Column`, and this field is null in the database, **there should be no ambiguity** and **`null` should be assigned to the embedded property**. Otherwise (currently!) you get an empty, invalid value object that has non-nullable properties set to `null`. IMHO, the current implementation is broken here.
- when all `@Column` in the Embeddable are nullable, there should be a boolean setting in the `@Embedded` annotation that controls whether or not you want an empty value object or a `null` value when all fields are `null` in the database. **Your choice**.

Finally, you only have a real problem when you have a fully nullable embeddable, **and** want to make the distinction between a `null` property and an empty object. People have suggested to add an extra column in the table, which would work, but would add a ton of complexity for what I think is an edge case. To clarify, **I think this edge case should not be supported by Doctrine**.

Documenting how to install NVM for all users,AndreSteenveld,230340780,1,230340780,0,"I needed a global install of NVM because I have some node based cron jobs and a few legacy applications that are rather picky about which version of node they are able to work on. For a time I worked around this by sourcing the nvm script everywhere but that seems to be a somewhat unmaintainable solution. 

The requirements I have:
- NVM should just work in non-interactive sessions
- Every user should be able to select a installed version of node (or use ```$ nvm exec```)
- Some users should be able to install newer versions of node

This is the solution I came up with: (shout out to @icecoldphp, for the initial version)

0. I've done this on a debian 8 machine, as the root user
1. Create a group called ""nvm"", ```# groupadd nvm```
2. Add root to the nvm group ```# usermod -aG nvm root```
3. Goto the ```/opt``` directory and create a directory called nvm  
    - Make sure the groupd owner is nvm ```# chown :nvm ./nvm```
    - Set the permissions so that the group is allowed to write in there and all file will inherit the group ```# chmod g+ws ./nvm```
4. Follow the [git install](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#git-install) steps using ```/opt/nvm``` as the directory 
    - To make sure the group can also write aliases, cache downloads and install global packages make sure the directories exist and have the correct permissions:
    ```
    # mkdir /opt/nvm/.cache
    # mkdir /opt/nvm/versions
    # mkdir /opt/nvm/alias 
    
    # chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/.cache
    # chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/versions
    # chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/alias
    ```
5. Using the following snippet create ```/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```:
    ```#/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh
    #!/bin/bash

    export NVM_DIR=""/opt/nvm""
    [ -s ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" ] && . ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh""

    ```
6. Ensure that the script is executable ```# chmod +x /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```
7. If you want to use nvm in non-interactive sessions as well make sure to source the nvm file in ```/etc/bash.bashrc``` before the line saying ```# If not running interactively, don't do anything``` by adding ```. /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```.
8. For bash completion (which is inherently interactive ;) add ```[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/bash_completion""``` after the section about bash completion.

Every user can select a version of node (as the permissions for public are ```r-x```) and users in the nvm group can install and remove versions of node (permissions for the group are ```rwx```).

##### SUMMARY
ansible-vault decrypt allows the decryption of completely encrypted yaml files, but it will not decrypt vaulted variables in an unencrypted yaml file with encrypted variables.

It would be nice, for CLI purposes, to have decrypt take a partially encrypted file, and give us the decrypted text.

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
* create `test.yml` file with single encrypted variable encrypted by `~/.vault_pass.txt`
* ansible-vault decrypt file

```
ansible-vault decrypt test.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt

As a user, what would you expect the decrypted file to look like?

First thought is just to replace the !vault yaml scalar with the decrypted text. That probably makes the most sense for 'view'.

For 'decrypt' and especially 'edit', I'm not sure that will be sufficient. For 'edit', the re-encrypt phrase is going to need to be able to figure out which variable values originally came from a vaulted value. Especially if the file is edited significantly (reordering lines for example, or changing the variable name). 

So the file presented for editing would need to include some markers indicating the text that was decrypted/should be re-encrypted. A couple of ways to do that:

   1) Add comments to mark the text, and doing some text manipulation/regexes to replace it with encrypted text in place. Something like:

``` yaml
# START VAULT PLAINTEXT - my_var
my_var: my text goes here
# END VAULT PLAINTEXT - my_var
some_plain_var: blippy
```

  2) Add a new yaml type indicating text to be encrypted. Something like:

``` yaml
my_var: !vault-plaintext |
    my text goes here
some_plain_var: blippy
```

It would be best if we could yaml parse the input, decrypt the value, serialize the yaml to a file for editing, let user edit it, then yaml parse the results, encrypt the value, and serialize to yaml and save.

But... doing that with the available yaml parser would lose comments and ordering of maps.

So likely some in place string/text manipulations will be required.",False,0

The downside to that approach is that it points out the limitations of the current !vault format. It may also be useful to extend !vault to support getting a data structure with info in it instead of just the plain text scalar. At the moment, I'm not sure if it could do both but it seems possible.

Or could just call the extended info version of !vault  !vault-extended or similar.  At that point it might be possible to make !vault-extended the default vault blob format for vaulted files as well. ie, instead of
a vaulted file being:

```
$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
66393964663765613335633461643334393234346231666665306635323635333137306339356232

It would be yaml something like

``` yaml

@brettdh I think I can shed some light because you have most of the pieces.  `pipenv lock` doesn't install anything, and it doesn't claim to.

1. `Pipfile.lock` is a strictly-pinned dependency resolution using the pip-tools resolver based on the user's `Pipfile`

True, this only happens when I've changed pip's default args via environment variable; I was just pointing out that it was surprising that pipenv delegated to pip for installation but not for version locking; i.e. rather than locking what's installed, it locks what it thinks *should* be installed, potentially with unrequested upgrades.

Updating only one locked dependency,vphilippon,268049628,13,339707418,0,"@brettdh The locking mechanism include a notion of ""dependency resolution"" that does not exist in `pip`. Its handled by `pip-tools` (or rather, a patched version of it, integrated in a special way by `pipenv` that bring a few differences with the original tool). In short, the locking mechanism reads the `Pipfile` and performs a full dependency resolution to select a full set of package that will meet *every* constraints defined by the required packages *and their dependencies*.

@techalchemy 
> [...] it’s resolving with pip-tools that concerns me.

I'm not sure how those `--upgrade-strategy` would affect `pip-tools`, because it works on some low-level internals of `pip`. I have the feeling this would not give the expected result, as these option take into account what's installed, and that's not what's being dealt with in that mechanism. But we have another approach to this in `pip-tools` that could be done here.

The ""original"" `pip-tools` behavior is that it only updates what's is needed in the lockfile (in its context, its the requirements.txt), but this was ""lost"" in the way the resolver was integrated in `pipenv`. Let me explain why.

Pointing back to my resume of how `pip-tools` works: https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/issues/875#issuecomment-337717817
Remember the ""select a candidate"" part? That's done by querying the `Repository` object.
In `pipenv`, we directly configure a `PyPIRepository` for the `Resolver`, but `pip-tools` does something else, it uses a `LocalRequirementsRepository` object, which keeps the existing pins from the previously existing `requirements.txt` (if found), and ""fallbacks"" on `PyPIRepository`.

So in `pip-tools`, the following happens when selecting a candidate:
1. Query `LocalRequirementsRepository` for a candidate that match `foobar>=1.0,<2.0`.
1. Check if an existing pin meets that requirements:
    - If yes, return that pin as the candidate.
    - If not, query the `proxied_repository` (`PyPIRepository`) for the candidate.
1. Use the candidate returned

Effectively, it means that existing pins are given a ""priority"" as candidate to try first.

But in `pipenv`, currently, it simply:
1. Query `PyPIRepository` (directly) for a candidate that match `foobar>=1.0,<2.0`.
1. Use the candidate returned.

So, I think the same behavior for the locking in `pipenv` could be done by parsing the `Pipfile.lock` to get the existing pins and use a `LocalRequirementsRepository`, like `pip-tools` does in its `pip-compile` command.",False,0

Updating only one locked dependency,vphilippon,268049628,15,339791934,0,"@techalchemy 
- Parsing the `Pipfile.lock` to extract the existing pins: Haven't looked at that. Depends on how things are structured in `pipenv`. We need a set of `InstallRequirements` that represents the pins in the `Pipfile.lock`.
- Using `LocalRequirementsRepository`: Fairly easy: change our current `PyPIRepository` for a `LocalRequirementsRepository`.

---------------

But, as I'm looking into this, and following @brettdh comments, I realize a few things:
1. The current default `pipenv install` behavior doesn't match the `pipenv lock` behavior. Doing `pipenv install requests` alone won't update `requests` if a new version comes out (much like  straight `pip install`). However, doing `pipenv lock` will update the `Pipfile.lock` with the latest version of `requests` that matches the `Pipfile` specifier, and the dependency constraints.
There's 2 main way to see this:
    - A) The `Pipfile.lock` should stay as stable as possible by default, not changing pins unless required, in order to stay like the current environment, and only change in the event that we change the environment.
    - B) The `Pipfile.lock` should get the newest versions that respect the environment constrains/dependencies in order to freely benefit from the open ranges in the `Pipfile` and lib dependencies, allowing to continuously acquire new compatible versions in your environment. You can then run `pipenv update` to benefit from the fresh lock.

    IMHO, I would align the default behavior, which would be to go with A) by default. Because right now, everytime a lock is performed (i.e. after each installation), new versions can come in, which make the lockfile *drive the update of the environment*, which seems weird. But, this is arguable of course. While in development, I might want to continuously update my requirements to no get stale, like with B), so that should also be easily doable.

2. Even if we use `LocalRequirementsRepository` to avoid updating correct existing pins, and end up aligning the default behaviors, we then need to address the equivalent of `--upgrade` and `--upgrade-strategy` for the locking part. Currently, defining some environment variable (like `PIP_UPGRADE` and `PIP_UPGRADE_STRATEGY`) will affect the `pipenv install` behavior, but will not affect `pipenv lock`, as it doesn't affect the behavior of `pip-tools` (I confirmed that, as I was unsure at first).
Otherwise, there will be no way to update the environment without either deleting the `Pipfile.lock` (feels clunky, and ""all or nothing"") or *requiring* a newer version (I mean doing an explicit `pipenv install requests>2.18.4`, which requires you to *know* that a new version is out, and changes the specifier in the `Pipfile` itself, increasing the lower bound), which is wrong. As the ""original `pip-tools`"" doesn't deffer to `pip` to deal with this (as it's not related that what is currently installed), it offers an option to specify the dependencies to update in the lockfile, and simply remove the pins for these packages (or all) from the existing_pins list, effectively falling back to querying PyPI. I'm not sure how we can match the notion of ""--upgrade-strategy"" with this.

---------------

@techalchemy 
So while I was saying it was fairly easy to just ""align the default behavior"", I now realize that this would cause some major issue with being able to update the packages (as in: just fetch the latest version that match my current constraints).

This workflow can possibly work with the current configuration.  You can use `pipenv lock` to generate a lockfile, but `pipenv update` will reinstall the whole environment.  I'm pretty sure we can use one of our various output formats to resolve the dependency graph (we already have a json format as you know) and only reinstall things that don't align to the lockfile.

Regardless of whether you are in an A workflow or a B workflow, a few things seem constant to me, and I think this squares with what @techalchemy is saying as well:
* The result of `pipenv lock` should always be a lockfile that matches the environment.
* The result of `pipenv install` should always be an environment that matches the lockfile.

I'm ignoring implementation details, but that's kind of the baseline behavior I expect from a package manager with a lockfile feature.

Running `pipenv update` periodically allows you to stay in B mode as long as you want everything to be fresh, and having the ability to `pipenv install --upgrade requests` would allow specific updates of one package and its dependencies, without affecting packages that don't need to be upgraded unnecessarily.

Am I missing any use cases? I can think of optimizations for B - e.g. a flag or env var that tells it to always update eagerly - but I think that covers the basics.

@brettdh this is correct -- the `pip-tools` resolver we use to generate `Pipfile.lock` doesn't ask the virtualenv for a list of which packages have been installed.  Instead, it compiles a list of packages that meet the criteria specified in the list of pins from the `Pipfile`.  Because the resolver itself runs using the system or outer python / pipenv / pip-tools install, we are doing some supreme fuckery to convince it to resolve packages with the same version of python used in the virtualenv.  The assumption would be that `pip install` would resolve things similarly, but that isn't always the case, although even I'm not 100% sure about that.  But yes, `pipenv lock` is not generated based on the virtualenv, it is generated based on the `Pipfile`.  It is a dependency resolution lockfile, not an environment state pin.",False,0

Updating only one locked dependency,rfleschenberg,268049628,28,366333367,0,"Sorry to comment on a closed issue, but I'd like to point out that, to my understanding, using pipenv in my projects currently requires a workflow like this:

```
pipenv install foo
vim Pipfile.lock  # Manually remove all the unwanted updates
git add && git commit && git push
```

I find it really annoying having to communicate this to my team members. The alternative seems to be to pin everything to exact versions in `Pipfile`, but that defeats much of the purpose of using pipenv in the first place.

IIUC, this behavior is the equivalent of `apt` performing an implicit `apt dist-upgrade` whenever you run `apt install foo`.

This is made worse by the fact that `pipenv install` updates stuff in `Pipfile.lock`, but does not install the updates into the local virtualenv. If the developer does not carefully examine the diff of `Pipfile.lock`, they are still using the older versions locally, but once they share the code, all other environments see the surprising updates. People have a tendency to ignore the diff of `Pipfile.lock` because it's considered an auto-generated file.

Why though? I never understood this idea that you should manage the dependencies of  a library and an application differently. The only difference between the two is the lock file which is needed for an application to ensure a reproducible environment. Other than that it's the same thing. This is the standard in most other languages and Python seems the exception here for some reason and this is bad from a user experience standpoint since this is making things more complex than they should be.

I understand that the issue tracker is most a place where to discuss bugs and improvements, and discuss whether this is a bug or an error by design is not clear in the thread, but again my apologies.

I thing there are two strong topics here:
- Should pipenv update all your outdated dependencies where you are trying just to install a new dependency: the ones that are not needed to update because the new package / version we are trying to install can works with the existent dependencies, and even the ones that aren't dependencies of the new package we are trying to install?

- Do one of these parameters `--keep-outdated` `--selective-upgrade` allow us to avoid these behaviour? It's not clear what these options do, there is a lack of documentation about them, and even in the related issue (#1554) nobody is answering that.

In case it's a bug in on one of these params `--keep-outdated` `--selective-upgrade`, I still thinking that do not set whatever param solves the unnecessary update of the dependencies as default it's a really bad idea.

To compare with a similar scenario, imagine that you execute `apt-get install vim` to just install the `vim` tool in your system (and the necessary vim's dependencies or updates if apply), but imagine also that in this situation apt updates all the other dependencies of your system: python, the QT system, the Linux kernel... and so on.

Well this is certainly off topic but it's an important discussion so I can't help myself.

There is actually no standard around `setup.cfg` right now other than the conventions established by distutils and setuptools. `pyproject.toml` is absolutely for library metadata as the successor to `setup.py` or the community would have placed build requirements in `setup.cfg` instead. 

`pyproject.toml` describes how to build a project (PEP 518), and part of building is describing metadata. I'm NOT saying that `pyproject.toml` needs a standard location for this metadata, but PEP 518 uses this file to install a build tool and from there it's very reasonable to expect that the build tool will use declarative configuration from somewhere else in the file to determine how to build the project.

Anyway, going back to pipenv vs poetry - there seems to be some idea floating around that applications don't need certain features that libraries get, like entry points, and this is just incorrect. It should be straightforward for an application to be a python package.

The only true difference between an application and a library in my experience with python and with other ecosystems is whether you're using a lockfile or not. Of course there's a third case where you really just want a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` and no actual code and that seems to be all that pipenv has focused on so far (`pipenv install -e .` falls into this category as pipenv is still afraid to try and support the package metadata). Unfortunately, while the design of pipenv is cleaner with this approach, it's also way less useful for most applications because PEP 518 decided to punt on how to install projects into editable mode so in order to continue using pipenv we will be stuck on setuptools quite a while longer as you cannot use `pyproject.toml` to switch away from setuptools and still use `pipenv install -e .`.",False,0

Distutils is part of the standard library and setuptools is installed with pip now, so saying that there is no standard is a bit silly.  Not to mention it uses the standard outlined in pep 345 for metadata, among others, and can also be used to specify build requirements.

Do you mean the pep authors?  You can ask them why they made their decision, they outline it all in the pep.

I'm NOT saying that pyproject.toml needs a standard location for this metadata, but PEP 518 uses this file to install a build tool and from there it's very reasonable to expect that the build tool will use declarative configuration from somewhere else in the file to determine how to build the project.

This came up on the mailing list recently -- nothing anywhere has declared a standard around `pyproject.toml` other than that it will be used to declare build system requirements. Anything else is an assumption; you can call that ""library definition metadata"", but it isn't.  Try only defining a build system with no additional information about your project (i.e. no pep-345 compliant metadata) and upload it to pypi and let me know how that goes.

> Anyway, going back to pipenv vs poetry - there seems to be some idea floating around that applications don't need certain features that libraries get, like entry points, and this is just incorrect. It should be straightforward for an application to be a python package.

Who is saying that applications don't require entry points?  Pipenv has an entire construct to handle this.

> so in order to continue using pipenv we will be stuck on setuptools quite a while longer as you cannot use pyproject.toml to switch away from setuptools and still use pipenv install -e .

That's correct, it is not a ""standard"", yet in that same thread recognise that by calling it `pyproject.toml` they likely asked for people to use this file for other project related settings/config.

So by the same logic you invoked here:

> Distutils is part of the standard library and setuptools is installed with pip now, so saying that there is no standard is a bit silly.

PEP 517 punted on editable installs... which means there is no standard way to install a project in editable mode if you are not using setup tools (which has a concept known as develop mode which installs the project in editable mode).",False,0

Yes, the build system is expected to output the PKG-INFO file described in PEP 345. This is a transfer format that goes in an sdist or wheel and is generated from a setup.py/setup.cfg, it is not a replacement as such for the user-facing metadata. PEP 518's usage of `pyproject.toml` is about supporting alternatives to distutils/setuptools as a build system, no one is trying to replace the sdist/wheel formats right now. Those replacement build systems need a place to put their metadata and fortunately PEP 517 reserved the `tool.` namespace for these systems to do so. It's not an assumption - **both flit and poetry have adopted this namespace for ""library definition metadata"".**

How constructive.

> Who is saying that applications don't require entry points? Pipenv has an entire construct to handle this.

Where is this construct? I cannot even find the word ""entry"" on any page of the pipenv documentation at https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ so ""an entire construct"" sounds pretty far fetched? If you mean editable installs then we have reached the point I was making above - with pipenv deciding to couple itself to `pipenv install -e .` as the only way to hook into and develop an application as a package, for the foreseeable future pipenv's support here is coupled to setuptools. I think the entire controversy boils down to this point really and people (certainly me) are frustrated that we can now define libraries that don't use setuptools but can't develop on them with pipenv. To be perfectly clear this isn't strictly pipenv's fault (PEP 518 decided to punt on editable installs), but its refusal to acknowledge the issue has been frustrating in the discourse as poetry provides an alternative that does handle this issue in a way that's compliant with the `pyproject.toml` format.

Great, and we are happy to accommodate sdists and wheels built using this system and until there is a standard for editable installs we will continue to pursue using pip to build sdists and wheels and handle dependency resolution that way.  Please read my responses in full.  The authors and maintainers of pip, of the peps in question, and myself and @uranusjr are pretty well versed on the differences between editable installs and the implications of building them under the constraints of pep 517 and 518.  So far All I'm seeing is that the peps in question didn't specifically address how to build them because they leave it up to the tooling, which for some reason everyone thinks means pipenv will never be able to use anything but setuptools? 

I've said already this is not correct.  If you are actually interested in the implementation and having a productive conversation I'm happy to have that.

No need to become personal, especially not dissing ""volunteering efforts"" in any Open Source project.

I meant it is much more relevant to us as in no-one else (apart from other version control software or services, like git or GitHub) deals with the one question which none of the official pages deal with: how to deal with user contributions that are intrinsic to the software.

If anyone of us would know what is needed to fix the software, we would do it. Can you point out what needs fixing? I don't think that is possible, most certainly not ""simple"".
I have the feeling no-one really understands any specifics about GDPR (and that includes the big guys like Google and Facebook). I think the majority of what's out there is misinformation.

I like how OpenStreetMap (who ""have received professional counsel"") say in their paper:

As Anika says, cookies do not store the IP (or even DNS entry) of the user, the IP address is instead sent with every request.

Not storing IP addresses is also not the solution as there is a very valid reason to store them at least temporarily: detect and remove vandalism (by IP address you can identify the connection between several edits, possibly even several user accounts) and to be able to identify the author (at least in court) if the content posted was illegal and the site owner gets sued because of that.

What I think would be a good thing is to have some automatic way to remove IP addresses after some time, at least for changes where the user has been logged in (this could be a plugin of course). For anonymous edits I'm not sure if the IP address can be interpreted as an author identification that needs to be stored because of the license (but this of course depends on the selected license).

Concerning the removal of the user name: my personal (non-lawyer) interpretation is that due to the license of the content (creative commons license at least with attribution), DokuWiki has a legitimate interest to store this attribution as it otherwise cannot use the content and as the Wikimedia issue tracker says ""the right of erasure only exists when the processing is not necessary for some legitimate interest of the data controller"".",False,0

It's the very nature of any cookie to come with IP address or DNS records attached. All of them are stored in the browser, only. Still GDPR considers them to be personal data, which is why they have to become session cookies or ask for user content before being placed. Fairly simple basics.

> If anyone of us would know what is needed to fix the software, we would do it.

daylight saving breaks `+minutes()`,Demetrio92,421471669,1,421471669,0,"Adding minutes to a date around daylight saving creates NAs

```R

tsp_initial + minutes(1160)
## NA
```

Bug or Feature? 
It definitely broke my until-now-working code.

----------------

## FIX:

```R
tsp_initial = ymd_hms('2019-03-09 07:22:03') %>% force_tz('US/Pacific')
tsp_initial + dminutes(1160)
## ""2019-03-10 03:42:03 PDT""
```

---------

## Explanation

`period` and `duration` act differently when adding a timespan to a date. Consider a simpler example: on the 30th of January what's the date on the calendar in a month from now? 

`period` will tell you it's 30th of February and as this is not possible will produce an NA
```r
ymd_hms(""2021-01-30 11:00:00"") + months(1)  # NA
```

`duration` will add some vague 30 days and return a different date depending on the year. 
```r
ymd_hms(""2021-01-30 11:00:00"") + dmonths(1)  # ""2021-03-01 21:30:00 UTC""
ymd_hms(""2020-01-30 11:00:00"") + dmonths(1)  # ""2020-02-29 21:30:00 UTC""

The summary is that I think that right here, there should be another if branch that says if we are ONLY updating using hours/min/sec or lower, then it should use `cl_new.pre` if the new civil seconds amount is above the old civil seconds amount (i.e. we went forward), otherwise use `cl_new.post` (we went backwards).

I've read the docs in `?Period-class`, and I know you want this reversible property:

```
date + period - period = date
```

I would argue that if it the arithmetic only involves hours/minutes/seconds then this is reversible. For my example above, I think that this is perfectly reasonable behavior (lubridate doesn't do this right now):

``` r
library(lubridate, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

border <- with_tz(as_datetime(1300000380 - 781) , ""America/New_York"")
border
#> [1] ""2011-03-13 01:59:59 EST""

border + seconds(1)

border + seconds(1) - seconds(1)

```

<sup>Created on 2019-09-06 by the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) (v0.2.1)</sup>

With days, you can't enforce the reversible behavior, so this behavior would result in an `NA`, not the problematic result shown here (again, this is my custom version)

``` r
library(lubridate, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

border <- with_tz(as_datetime(1300000380 - 781) , ""America/New_York"")

border_minus_a_day <- border - days(1)
border_minus_a_day
#> [1] ""2011-03-12 01:59:59 EST""

one_day_one_second <- days(1) + seconds(1)
one_day_one_second
#> [1] ""1d 0H 0M 1S""

# This SHOULD result in an NA
border_minus_a_day + one_day_one_second
#> [1] ""2011-03-13 03:00:00 EDT""

# Because this is not reversible
border_minus_a_day + one_day_one_second - one_day_one_second

Preexisting rationale for this behavior in Java:

- https://www.javacodex.com/Date-and-Time/Testing-Daylight-Saving-By-Adding-One-Second",False,0
daylight saving breaks `+minutes()`,DavisVaughan,421471669,8,529114335,0,"Hmm okay I think the rule could be if we land in the spring forward daylight savings time gap and `(period size) <= (dst gap size)` then it is a reversible operation and we should get a real date and not an `NA`. 99% of the time this means if `(period size) <= 1 hour`, but there are the _rare_ cases where a dst gap is not 1 hour.

(Note that this would imply that the original issue would still be an `NA` because `minutes(1160)` is larger than 1 hour, and would not be reversible)

I would try to implement this, but I can't figure out how to get the size of the dst gap using cctz.

That rule is unfortunate. There is no solid reason to follow it and it caused a lot of trouble with the package. There is a new lower level package `timechange` which has a clear defined semantics and allows a full control over how things are rolled both on month change and DST.

daylight saving breaks `+minutes()`,DavisVaughan,421471669,15,813387353,0,"For anyone doing arithmetic with _hours, minutes, or seconds_ with lubridate, you likely want to use Durations objects (like `dhours()`) rather than Period objects (like `hours()`). For arithmetic with more granular units of time like days, months or years, you probably want to stick with Period objects.

So, if using lubridate, my advice for @Demetrio92 and @robertwwalker is to switch to `dminutes()` and `dhours()` as that seems to be what you are expecting. That will match your intuition if you were expecting a result equal to ""sitting in a chair for 1160 minutes, then looking at the clock"" (assuming that your clock automatically adjusts itself for DST).

You could also try using [clock](https://clock.r-lib.org/). The POSIXct API in clock defaults to the behavior I described in the first paragraph, so it might feel more intuitive. It also errors when landing on a nonexistent time in a DST gap, or on an ambiguous time in a DST fallback, rather than returning `NA`.

@Demetrio92's original example:

```r

# - adds 1160 minutes (2019-03-09 07:22:03 -> 2019-03-10 02:42:03)
# - converts back to US/Pacific, but this is now in a DST gap from

Reading `period` docs
> Within a Period object, time units do not have a fixed length (except for seconds) until they are added to a date-time.  ... When math is performed with a period object, each unit is applied separately. How the length of a period is distributed among its units is non-trivial. For example, when leap seconds occur 1 minute is longer than 60 seconds.

> Periods track the change in the ""clock time"" between two date-times. They are measured in common time related units: years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Each unit except for seconds must be expressed in integer values.

I do not  see why this description contradicts my expected output. 

Specifically it says stuff like 
>or example, when leap seconds occur 1 minute is longer than 60 seconds. 

My impression here would be that periods are more robust than durations. 

-----

I generally agree, the issue is more deep than just two functions that supposed to do the same. 

Still, worst case, rename `minutes` into `pminutes`.

I am glad `period` now contains a warning. At least people who carefully study the docs will be aware. 
> Note: Arithmetic with periods can result in undefined behavior when non-existent dates are involved (such as February 29th in non-leap years). Please see Period for more details and %m+% and add_with_rollback() for alternative operations.

Hmm, @pitakakariki from this example it looks to me like you might misunderstand how Period and Duration are supposed to be working. Let me try explaining. I'll use types from clock, since they allow me to explicitly show the intermediate steps that are happening under the hood.

library(clock)

x
#> [1] ""2021-04-04 02:15:00 NZDT""

# Adding a lubridate ""Period"" is like:
# - Dropping the original time zone completely
# - Adding the unit of time
# - Adding the original time zone back (if possible)

# Adding a lubridate ""Duration"" is like:
# - Converting the original time zone to UTC (where DST never affects you)
# - Adding the unit of time
# - Adding the original time zone back (which is always possible)

# We can show these explicitly with clock's naive-time and sys-time types, which
# mimic dropping the original time zone and converting to UTC respectively.
```

nt_plus_hour

#> [1] ""2021-04-04 03:15:00""

# Now we convert back to Pacific/Auckland. Since the 3 o'clock hour is past
# the DST fallback, there is no ambiguity in the conversion, but it may or
# may not be what you want.

Video width and height are switched when a vertically-oriented game is loaded,Patrickdroid,430055555,1,430055555,0,"## Description

With vertically oriented games, Retroarch switches the emulator-provided width and height. For example, if the width/height is supposed to be 320x240, RA will switch this to 240x320. This only occurs with vertically oriented games. I tested this in both MAME and FBA using the Windows 64 bit version of RA. 

### Expected behavior

The game to be displayed using the correct resolution (width/height). 

### Actual behavior

The height and width is switched when a vertically oriented game is loaded. 

### Steps to reproduce the bug

1. load any vertically oriented game in either FBA or MAME using Windows 64 bit version of RA (example: DonPachi)
2. under video settings, enable integer scale. 
3. set ""custom aspect ratio width/height"" to 1x.
4. look at ""custom aspect ratio width/height"" to see that it says 240 for width and 320 for height. This is the reverse of what it should be; it should be 240 for height and 320 for width. 

### Bisect Results

I first noticed this a few days ago.

If the game is 320x240 it should be output as 320x240, not 240x320. The user can flip it or rotate it or resize it or whatever, but the output resolution from the emulator should remain the same (eg, 320x240 should be output as 320x240 before the user does stuff to it). Otherwise you get scaling artifacts unless you just happen to adjust the y axis to a multiple of both 240 and 320 (eg, 960). And if you’re playing a game that uses a weird resolution like 19XX (384x240), then it causes big problems with overscan or underscan when using integer scaling. As of right now, video aspect ratio for vertical games must be configured manually (custom ratio width/height, non-integer) along with custom ratio x/y position, because the resolution/ratio for vertical games isn’t being detected correctly.

It draws the image on the monitor as 4:3 then you flip the monitor physically this changes it to 3:4 on real hardware as far as the hardware is concerned its a normal 4:3 device but your rendering the image 90 degrees rotated.

In mame2003 or plus just use tate mode this stop the rotation and you need to flip your monitor like a real one. look at sf2 this is on a 4:3 screen look at the resolution of the game it use crt timing when rendering to look the way it does in a crt if you used the literal resolution for sf2 the gfx would be overly stretched.

I understand very well that certain games are meant to be displayed vertically. This doesn’t change anything that I’ve said. 

With a vertically-oriented 320x240 game, width should say 320 and height should say 240, and the displayed image should be sideways. On a 4:3 CRT monitor the image would be 320x240 and sideways. You then rotate the monitor 90 degrees. This doesn’t change the image to 240x320. It is still 320x240 but now it is rotated 90 degrees so it is no longer sideways.

Altering the internal resolution of the game is incorrect, and will always result in scaling artifacts unless you happen to use a resolution that is a multiple of both 320 and 240.

I.e. the generated file would look *as if* `composer.json` were in the `src/php/` directory. Only descending the folder tree would be allowed, so you cannot do something like `""autoloader-root-dir"": ""../somewhereElse/""`. The name `autoloader-root-dir` is tentative.

## Motivation

### Built applications

In modern web development, codebases quite often use multiple languages, some of them compiled (typically something akin to TypeScript compiled to JavaScript). This means that the final application needs to be built. To cleanly separate the source files from the build artifacts, one would want to place all the source files into one directory (e. g. `src`) and have the built app in another one (e. g. `dist`). However, the `composer.json` file would typically be in the root of the repository - that is, *not* in the `src` folder. Under the current behaviour, there is no way to do this, not have the final php files somewhere like `dist/src/` and have a working autoloader. This RFC would enable that by setting `""autoloader-root-dir"": ""src/""`.

### Separating configuration files from the application itself

When an app is deployed, sometimes it is undesirable to deploy configuration files such as `.travis-ci.yml` or similar. With this RFC, one could put the actual application in a dedicated directory (e. g. `app/`), keep all the configuration files (including `composer.json`) in the root of the repo and still have a working autoloader by setting `""vendor-dir"": ""app/vendor""` and `""autoloader-root-dir"": ""app/""`.

I would like to create (with any build system, I don't really care) a `dist` directory which I could upload to a webhosting (it being a build artifact as @alcohol pointed out). I imagined it being of the sort:

```
├── index.php
├── MyApp
│   └── MyClass.php
├── js
      └── ...
└── vendor
      └── ...
```

But, by now, the path from `vendor/composer/autoload_static.php` to `MyApp/MyClass.php` has changed. So the autoloading would no longer work. But with the proposed new config parameter, I could set 
```json
""config"": {
    ""autoloader-root-dir"": ""src/php/""
}
```
and then autoloading would work in the build artifact directory.

Why not just use `vendor-dir` then? Because that would require me putting the `vendor` dir in `src/php`. But the `vendor` dir **is not** source code for me - therefore, I wouldn't want it in the `src` directory.

Clearer now? I think the exact organization of the `dist` directory could be different a bit, but the overall idea would stay the same. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.",False,0

Thanks for the advice, I did not know that.

However, unfortunately, this is not a good solution on its own - I can't set the webroot to `src/php` as the files in `src` are sources - not build artifacts.

`NaN` values is an app level problem from our point of view since the user is in some sense the data producer. Geometric data like position, normal or color data are meant to be numerical. `NaN` data are no numerical data.

Handling `NaN` values is use case specific since proper default values depend on what the application actually does.

Feature Request: Optionally Raise Some or All Vanilla Engine Limits,HollowedEmpire,528942466,1,528942466,0,"First off, I love Chocolate Doom and how accurate and true it is to the original executables - right down to bugs.

Though one particular aspect that I feel may be good to be able to alter is the static limits of the engine, such as the visplane limits. Preferably this could be done as an extra command line argument or configuration setting. When not specified, the normal limit values can be used as a default.

These limits in the engine have no real affect on how the game is actually _played_, so I feel providing an optional way to adjust them would still be true to the _vanilla experience_ and not go against the philosophy of the project. It's akin to how all the networking changes _aren't_ 'true to the original' Doom, or how the Vanilla Save Game Limit or Vanilla Demo Limit are already optional changes you can make. All these changes are to give the _vanilla experience_ a greater range of access, just as they are all equally not 'true' and are not 'pure' to the original.

To make the code change as minimal as possible, it could be as simple as specifying numbers for the limits (i.e. visplane array size). One could simply set them to high values in order to run more intensive maps. Another possible and more elegant solution could be letting Chocolate Doom read the map data and set the array limits dynamically at map load time to match what is present.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who would love to use Chocolate Doom for SiGiL and other maps that are otherwise only incompatible due to these hard coded limits.

> In `win32unix` and `nvim` it works instead (**it changes the buffer name to the real path**).

All of Fugitive is built around the assumption that the buffer name is the the real path. At first I ignored this, but then bugs cropped up when people called `:cd` and the buffer name changed from a symlink path to a real path mid flight, so my solution was to force a `:cd .` early, thus preventing symlink paths from ever entering the equation. What you've told me is that this `:cd .` doesn't work. Two solutions spring to mind:

1. Find a way to make it work (where ""make it work"" is ""resolve symlink in the buffer name"").
2. If there is no way to make it work, then the original bug is irrelevant. Stop calling `resolve()` on the Git dir and work tree and everything should be back to matched up.

The following solutions do not spring to mind:

1. Change the semantics of one public function by adding `resolve()` to it, and verify that the one command that is confirmed broken is fixed.

Please stop doubling down on the bad idea that I told you is bad, and try the thing I asked you to try:

> I would start with exe 'cd' fnameescape(getcwd()).

Ironically, after I started writing this you edited in a decent idea.

See also https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/pull/814#issuecomment-446767081 where I attempt to provide a more robust way to do this automatically. This is the sort of thing I would consider doing, but getting to work right requires calling `edit` to reload the file, and I worry that editing the file from `BufReadPost` will cause non-obvious bugs. I would encourage you to try it, at least until the issue is fixed.",False,Mocking

I will repeat for the last time : THE TEST REQUIRES THE BUG TO BE PRESENT.

The bug manifests itself by outputting ``Label 0`` for -1 < indexes < 0 instead of outputting an empty string ``""""``. 

The test is passed when the bug is present, that is when``Label 0`` is wrongly outputted. 
The test fails when the bug is NOT present, that is when ``IndexFormatter``  returns an empty string, ``""""``, AS IT SHOULD.

The solution --- which consists only of rounding the index value, ``round(i)``  instead of truncating the index value, ``int(i + 0.5)`` --- returns an empty string, ``""""``.  The solution fails the test because the test is WRONG. The test is by itself A BUG.

> From my point of view we have been waiting on you.

I CANNOT CORRECT THE TEST. IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND PREROGATIVE.

> the need to document the API changes

If you adopt the solution, THERE NO NEED TO CHANGE THE DOCUMENTATION NOR THE API

> why IndexFormatter should not be deprecated)

Because, WITH THE SOLUTION instead a deprecation :

1. IndexFormatter works. It simply works, as intended, without any bug.
2. ``IndexFormatter(x_labels)`` is far simpler than proposed convoluted alternatives like ``FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: dict(zip(range(len(x_labels)), x_labels)).get(x, """"))`` to achieve the same exact end result.
3. The solution doesn't break back compatibility in the middle of minor revision. The users don't have to change their programs. They don't have to find an alternative. 
4. It follows the precepts of semantic versioning instead of adopting post hoc rationalisations (like ""others deprecated functionalities in the middle of minor revision so lets pretend it's okay for us to do the same"")
5. You don't have to spend time and energy changing the documentation. You don't have to teach the users alternative methods that are necessarily harder to implement and explain.
6. Apparently, the DEPRECATION is based, at least partially, on the false assumption that a decade of zero complaints from the users somehow means the users are unhappy with IndexFormatter and therefore don't use it. 
7. THE DEPRECATION misses entirely the point of avoiding the vicious cycle of complexity. Increasing complexity to achieving the same exact functionality is a huge waste of your time. It only make you busier and busier, writing more convoluted code and spending more time managing harder to debug bugs.

Out of box, retroarch is extremely complex even for advanced users. Who thought that F1 is great idea for menu? Why not escape like in usual games/emulators?

The only advantage of ra vs standalone emulators is that it support shader and TECHNICALLY it could be better, but on practice its 100mb of shader folder. Whats wrong with syncronization, why snes has sound crackling out of box? U link syncronization with monitors sync rate but it seems like it changes.  Why you cant do like previous old emulators did and somehow link emulation with stable generator? Its not very bad if u sync game with time, not display

Why sound should lag in 2020?

Why you linked sound control with DB and pression +- returns random volume?

I don't remember the exact name now but some libxxx-c2 and libxxx-c3 weren't possible to install from Ubuntu Focals own repos (clean ISO from their site), hence `make deb` failed. I did `apt-get install libxxx*` (1500 MB of packages) just to don't miss out on anything, but still - no success.

Have you heard of [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) already? It has a rewritten resolver but is fully compatible with the conda-ecosystem. Not only does it solve the biggest problem of the conda-solver (speed), but it also correctly sets up the environment here:

There was one other way I hadn't thought about - fixing the conda-forge repodata directly. This was done yesterday, and means the problem is fixed _within_ conda-forge, i.e. when using strict channel priority (ignoring the main anaconda package that still has the same problem) - which unfortunately is not the out-of-the-box behaviour for conda though.

You can either do this for a single install (e.g. `conda create -n test --strict-channel-priority python=3.8 ipython`), but the recommended way (see e.g. [here](https://conda-forge.org/)) is persisting that setting with

I am really disappointed that the maintainer of a great product as Ipython has such a limited knowledge about the problem.
The fact that Ipython has not been pinning jedi means that any version of it released in the past that depends on jedi is at its merci to stop working as soon as a no backwards compatible change is introduced and used in Ipython.
By changing Ipython to make it jedi 0.18 compatible and releasing 7.20 you make that 7.20 operational today. If tomorrow jedi makes another backwards incompatible change We will be screwed again.
And you can't blame jedi for backwards incompatible changes because it is not even 1.x and you are not even pinning the major.

I'm amazed that someone that contribute squat is telling me what i'm doing wrong without tryign to really think about the problem.

- Say I pin IPython 7.20 to jedi <0.19 , and david release jedi 0.19. 
- pip is no free to say ""hey let's install jedi 0.19 and downgrade IPython to 5.x"". 
- Bam you are wrong™️ . 💎 🚀 🌕 

And second the change of API were in jedi 0.17 with deprecation warnings and fix in master close to a year ago; I thought that by now 8.0 would be out. 

FYI about me know nothing about versioning:
  - I spend month implementing on pushing the `python_requires` logic in pypi, and in pip to make sure when IPython dropped it did not break for Python 2 users
  - I'm one of the regular advocate to have version medata data and package content to be separated in conda/pypi for this exact reason.
  - It's not because something seem obvious that it's correct.

You could have just asked in for a question ""why are not you pinning to <0.19 starting with IPython 7.20"", to which I would have responded.
So not only you are impolite and haven't done your research,  everybody see you incorrectly assume you know better than others and  you've lost all credibility.

I seriously get the impression that Pandas is actively being sabotaged. As a case in point, `DataFrame.lookup` was deprecated in v1.2. The problems with this are:

1. The [doc for `DataFrame.lookup`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.lookup.html) says to see itself for an example. Well, there is no example in the doc page. The only example I'm aware of is [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#looking-up-values-by-index-column-labels) instead which is a different page.
2. The [changelog](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.2.0.html#deprecations) for this deprecation points to [GH18682](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/18682) which looks to be wholly irrelevant to this change. A lot has gone wrong here.
3. There is significant user code that already uses `lookup`. Why break it? If the current implementation of `lookup` is suboptimal, shouldn't it be optimized instead?
4. It is extremely complicated to use `melt` when `lookup` works quite simply. For example, compare [this simple answer using `lookup`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45487394/) with [this complicated answer using `melt`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65722008/).

Regarding the lambda function, that was originally an attempt to chain the three lines to detect possible speed improvement. Answer was not.

Using `.loc[melt['col']==melt['variable'],...]` wouldn't improve/change anything.

`np.unique` is used on the column names, so most likely will be strings. In general case, we can use instead, `pd.Series.unique()` and `pd.Series.factorize()` for that single line. But as far as I know, those two also returns `np.array`. 

Also, can you name some Pandas datatypes that wouldn't work with `np.unique`, especially those one would use as column names?

I did a quick check and seems like `lookup` wasn't a for loop actually, only for columns with mixed types. So the in terms of speed it looks okay.

For your approach, I agree that it's more efficient both in speed and memory allocation, but I remember writing multiple methods to replace `lookup` and I decided to go with melt since it was most ""readable"", without making it too complex for the documentation.

So I think it all boils down to @jreback and the argument that `DataFrame.lookup` has not been used as much, which is being discussed by @impredicative

However, in the case that `col` is a column in the data (e.g. in my test or in the proposed solution) it's almost certainly that `self._is_mixed_type == True`. So you are right that it is just a for loop as of now. Still, it's faster than the proposed `melt` method.

```python

>>> pd.Series(values, index=index.index)

What should I do to use `melt` instead of `lookup`? And why can't I use high-level lookup API like before? Maybe I just stupid, but I do not want to think about it and dive into ornate concepts, I just want to implement the algorithm in high-level clean code. I want to keep my code simple and the code should clearly express my **intention**.

The code example from SO is tricky.
```
df['new_col'] = df.melt(id_vars='names', value_vars=['a', 'b'], ignore_index=False).query('names == variable').loc[df.index, 'value']
```

Ask yourself what **intention** it expresses. This is some kind of esoteric gibberish without reference to the subject area. The code is too low-level and verbose compared to the simple and concise `lookup(rows, cols)`.",False,Bitter frustration

@jreback I think it's you that not comparing apples to apples here: **none** of those APIs you listed offer `lookup` functionality (otherwise, you wouldn't have used `melt` as an alternative). `lookup` is a direct translation of `arr[list_1, list_2]` from Numpy to Pandas. The Numpy API is there and it looks like it will stay for a while, why remove Pandas' equivalent.

The fact that there was a release roughly a month ago (2020-12-04) should tell you that the project is not inactive. The work on an upcoming 2.9.x release could also help indicate at some activity. Not to mention the activity in sister projects like dbal and the releases there.

Remove libpq dependency in RStudio Desktop,2011,807725060,1,807725060,0,"### System details

    RStudio Edition : Desktop
    RStudio Version : 1.4.1103
    OS Version      : Linux 5.4.80 #1 SMP GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
    R Version       : 3.4.1

### Steps to reproduce the problem

Version 1.3.1093 did not dynamically link to libpq (from PostgreSQL), but 1.4.1103 does.

One can verify this by simply running ldd /path/to/rstudio.

### Describe the problem in detail

The Release Notes at:

https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/release-notes/

mention that RStudio Server Pro now requires a Postgres database, but says nothing about RStudio Desktop (and lacks any explanation why the Desktop version would require a database).

### Describe the behavior you expected

I would expect database connectivity to remain in the odbc package, and not pushed into the basic desktop. I strongly object to requiring something not found in a typical desktop setup, and request that if this dependency remains, you provide the necessary libraries with the RStudio Desktop installation (as you do with the Qt libraries and icu - both of which most Linux desktop machines already have).

- [x] I have read the guide for [submitting good bug reports](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/wiki/Writing-Good-Bug-Reports).
- [x] I have installed the latest version of RStudio, and confirmed that the issue still persists.

WHY?  I have used RStudio desktop for years, and it never had this requirement before version 1.4.

1. RStudio desktop should not require this library.
2. Database connectivity should remain in the odbc package.
3. Typical desktop installations don't have this library (including mine - I would have to compile the entire PostgreSQL to upgrade to RStudio 1.4).
4. If you really feel that RStudio desktop absolutely **has** to have libpq, then why don't you provide it in the package? The installation package includes libraries for Qt and icu, which virtually every Linux desktop has.

The first half of your sentence is a garbled mess. We aren't talking about backups?

Since I didn't realize the dust recipe existed when I played (which you have now made the same) I never even used alumite tools (aside from maybe my pickaxe, to get the next mining level, which I believe I changed after I repaired it the first time), since they were too expensive.

After all I do not (yet?) hold or claim any copyrights in an ZeroMQ code.  This was a mere bugfix.

Different story are my Lua bindings at https://github.com/arcapos/luazmq <https://github.com/arcapos/luazmq> and https://github.com/arcapos/mqlua <https://github.com/arcapos/mqlua>, but then these are not part of the ZeroMQ project.

(probably?) not, but Github makes it very obvious when a first contribution is made, so it's easier to ask for it at that point, rather than tracking who sent it and who didn't if you then later submit a larger PR.

Well, I have no plans to contribute code, I am a mere (long time) user of ZeroMQ, and if it does not build, I invest some time trying to find out what is wrong. Maybe WITH_OPENPGM should be added to the automated tests.

QST: Inconsistent behaviour in checking number of fields per row while read_csv(),buhtz,908088395,1,908088395,0,"I post this as a ""Question"" because I am quite new to `pandas`. So maybe I miss some understandings and the ""problem"" described by me is by design and you have good reasons for that.
I use pandas 1.2.4, with Python 3.9.4 on Windows 10 64 bit.

As a user I would expect that pandas check the number of fields per row when importing via csv file. But IMHO it does not in all cases.

# Example 1

Here is a csv file __without header__ and but a set `names=` attribute with three fields. So pandas should be able to know how many fields/columns should be in the CSV file. The second row contains 4 instead of 3 fields.

```
import pandas
import io

csv_without_header = io.StringIO(
'A;B;C\n'
'D;E;X;Y\n'
'F;G;H'
)

df = pandas.read_csv(csv_without_header, encoding='utf-8', sep=';',
                     header=None,

Pandas import this without warnrings or errors. The 4th field in the 2nd row is simply ignored.

# Example 2

I added a header line into the csv file with again three fields.
So pandas should be able to know how many fields/columns should be in the CSV file.
And again the second row contains 4 instead of 3 fields.

```
csv_with_header = io.StringIO(
'First;Second;Third\n'
'A;B;C\n'
'D;E;X;Y\n'
'F;G;H'
)

df = pandas.read_csv(csv_with_header, encoding='utf-8', sep=';')
```

Here an error occurs as I expect.
`pandas.errors.ParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 3 fields in line 3, saw 4` 

# Example 3

There are less then 3 fields in the 2nd row. Again here is no warning or error. The missing field is set with `NaN`. And here it does not matter if you give the number of (expected) fields via header line in the CSV or via `names=` attribute.

```
csv_with_header = io.StringIO(
'First;Second;Third\n'
'A;B;C\n'
'D;Y\n'
'F;G;H'
)

csv_without_header = io.StringIO(
'A;B;C\n'
'D;Y\n'
'F;G;H'
)

df_a = pandas.read_csv(csv_with_header, encoding='utf-8', sep=';')
df_b = pandas.read_csv(csv_without_header, encoding='utf-8', sep=';', names=['First', 'Second', 'Third'])
```

QST: Inconsistent behaviour in checking number of fields per row while read_csv(),testingcan,908088395,2,852051470,0,"To me this behaviour is quite consistent with what I would expect a CSV import to do. Having a value outside of the defined columns just doesn't make any sense, so the `ParserError` is appropriate here. However, having a `NaN` or missing value is logically sound in my opinion and happens more often than not. 

For example, if the contents of your CSV file were from some input, where you have to enter three fields, but the CSV contains a row with four columns, this means you have a bigger problem. If you have a row with only two columns and one `NaN` that just means that one input was left blank and you need to handle the data appropriately. Since this is a case-by-case basis (e.g. do you still consider this a valid datum, do you ignore, do you populate it with default values?), but the other case is almost always a problem with the file, I think this behaviour makes sense. 

In any way, checking for empty values after importing is always a good step, using - in your third example - `df_a.isnull()` or `df_a.isnull().sum`. ",False,0

@refractionpcsx2 
I have only the NTSC version of both GoW1 and 2.  And from your screenshot I can see the internal resolution is different. 
iirc Sony Santa Monica rendered the FMV's in ddifferent resolutions for each region, 480 for NTSC and 576i for PAL. Which is why I believe you dont get the same bug I get.

This is what observed so far: on the my NTSC version
1.6.0 / 1.7.0 r1286:

GoW1 Has the Black border bug
GoW1 game runs at 512x448 inerlaced and 640x448 w/ progressive scan on
GoW1 FMV's run at 640x480 regardless
GoW1 FMV files are PSS files rendered at 640x480

on 1.4.0 the resolutions are the same, except that the bug happenes when I enable progressive scan.

GoW2 doesnt have this issue at all because the FMVs are at 640x448

Ibelieve thats the reason you dont experience the same bug because PAL FMV files are rendered at a higher res than NTSC

I extracted the files and examined them for both games to exmine them

This ticket is not about installation but generate sphinx documenation.
In my case I've copieed Fedora patch which is buggy and this is why setuptools sphoinx_build has been trying to find matplotlibrc file.
Here is that patch

After remove first block of that patch build_sphinx works but:
- still that comment or the code ahould be fixed
- looks like whole documentation is so badly wriytten that despite fact that I'm clearly specyfying that I want man format it tries generate graphiscs files, and tries to do sometningh with latex .. which shame becazuse it is most fundamental formanmt of the documentation on every U*nix platworm. How matplotlib is used by U*nix developers??
On trying generate man page sphinx fails with:

3.4.2: setuptools build_sphinx command fails,kloczek,917355114,13,859886232,1,"IMO it is kind of problem because ipythion needs matplotlib and on generate mathplot is needed ipython which creates automatic non planar graph in build dependencies.

List of used sphinx extensions is really gigantic looks like no one cares about KISS principle .. :/
I peaked on few fragments of the code and it looks sometimes like written by someone who just started learning python (usually overcomplicated). I'm 100% sure that it would be possible to remove a lot of lines of code without changing its functions and making it a lot simpler.
Last time I had similar impression reading ~12 years ago openssl code :(

I'm not trying to be rude or offensive (it is not my intention be like that) .. I'm only trying to be honest so please don't take that personally because it is counterproductive 
Looks like (at least for now) I would not be able to provide in my matplotlib rpm package basic documentation :(
Maybe in future ..",False,Mocking
LOADS of BUGS unworkable version 0.83.15 - NOT x86 assember/16bit DOS compatible - SANDBOX destroyed.,JimmyWalter,936567326,1,936567326,0,"**ALL worked very will in version 83.13**

**In PC-DOS 7.1 (IBM PC-DOS 2000)**
-The mouse acts REALLY strange in various applications and in Windows 3.11 (Win 3.11 crashes after strange mouse movements)
-Z (ZED) Game Setsound and ZED.EXE hang
-The mouse acts strange on the title-bar of the dosbox window
-Many applications and my own COM applications have problems

**SURE the new ""TALK to DOSBOX"" functionality cause this,**
YOU CAN'T JUST ADD/CHANGE ASSEMBLER INTERRUPTS (especially not before the bootstrap, if loading a custom image)
OSes and TSR Software may assign these interrupts. (I usually assign interrupts automatically with a driver installer routine for unhandled interrupts, the diver executable is then added to the next free interrupt)

**DosBox-X version 0.83.15 TOTALLY USELESS!** 
**IT IS JUST NOT 100% COMPATIBLE WITH x86 ASSEMBER IF YOU ADD CUSTOM INTERRUPTS,**
**THAT MIGHT BE FINE IF YOU WRITE A CUSTOM OS (NOT DOS COMPATIBLE) WITH A CUSTOM INTERRUPT TABLE.**
**NOT IF YOU NEED TO RUN 16 BIT DOS COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE (STANDARD x86 ASSEMBLER) , THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF DOSBOX, SO THIS VERSION IS TOTALLY USELES, SOME PROGRAMS WILL RUN BUT IT IS MORE LUCK THAN WISDOM. I EXPECT LOADS OF PROBLEMS IN MANY DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS.**

**Also this ""TALK to DOSBOX"" functionality destroys the SAND-BOX** 
An assembler debug run-point can now run from a DOS program into the Window of DosBox,, not handy since Python and CUDA reverse engineer applications on runtime while the machine AI is learning.

**This version should be deleted**
You should put the old version back until you make a release without the ""TALK to DOSBOX"" 
NEVER TALK TO THE SANDBOX. Your assembler run-point may go from the SANDBOX to the DOS bootstrap, but NEVER from DOS back in the sandbox. (Might cause strange infinite loops) Especially if you have Python and CUDA installed you can get VERY strange effects.  (EVEN WHEN NOT RUNNING, due to CUDA/Python working on it)

Maybe add a version history to the website this will also be good for machine learning (I use that a lot, it can be used for Pythagoras predictive code, best is if you have a complete version history, except versions like this, should not be in such a history list, (causes only problems) ONLY good versions, with NO bugs but added or changed features, that work.


**The whole IDEA of SANDBOX is you can't talk to the Window (You should do it like this)**
WHAT YOU DID IS AN ARCHITECTURE FLAW, AND ALSO A BUG.
To get the same effect you could let the Windows application POL the DOS Memory page for example let the Window react on that. memory content. (Like PEEK/POKE  You could turn the option OFF in the Windows and SANDBOX integrity is not changed ALSO compatibility is maintained.

**Helpful tool for doing it correctly**
It becomes super easy to program that if you make a memory viewer so you can browse LIVE trough your running DOS memory pages. A viewer can be made very advanced too and you can do things PETER-NORTON would be amazed by.

I suppose that was a bad idea, yes. I'll remove it.

@JimmyWalter Can you report which leftover interrupt handler is causing these issues?

@Wengier Could the new DOS/V and DBCS emulation be causing this?",False,0
LOADS of BUGS unworkable version 0.83.15 - NOT x86 assember/16bit DOS compatible - SANDBOX destroyed.,JimmyWalter,936567326,4,873704928,0,"Yes I updated my comment for you I am a TOP Assembler programmer in FACT I develop the DARPA.NET AI (You call it internet/TCP) probably what most people don't know is ONLY TCP components can be on internet Windows for example is build from my TCP component set (so is android and ubuntu, everything online must be built with these components)

The AI RIPS components from other programs in ANY language (Converted to assembler) and converts Assembler to Delphi TCP components if you write apps in dos, the AI will also take that assembler and build it into Delphi/TCP components. It's so effective I do most my work in DOS using ASIC (It's almost basic) and NASM. You can get those POWERFUL features no one else has like that.

FREE PASCAL, they stole that years ago I actually named it FAST PASCAL back then. Was part of the DARPA.NET AI
It wasn't supposed to be free(or even public) products where copyrighted and intended for personal use.

Someone stole my floppies long time ago, when backup options where very limited and any storage expensive. They ended up with Bill Gates, thank god the DARPA.NET AI was compiled and not in source and it included the certificate systems. So I'm the product-owner and eventually fired Bill @Microsoft

I can live with Pascal being free, that idea was ripped from Borland anyways. (I have my own custom version anyways)

What is so cool is that TCP components communicate with each other and the AI learns new components from that communication, that are not programmed by humans. Anything written in a dosbox will become a Delphi/TCP component also.

I have the development suite, but this functionality is default in any OS/SOFTWARE built form TCP components
Writing DOS programs might change details (or a lot if big program) in Windows/Ubuntu/Android or any other DARPA.NET connected product. GLOBALLY and instantly. The difference is, I get the components on my IDE toolbar since I own the product.

I don't write C /C++/C#(I CAN write C/C++/C#) I do Delphi NASM/TASM/x86 ASM and ASIC QUICK-PASCAL TURBO-PASCAL

I have no interrupt handlers momentarily I used IBM PC-DOS 7.01(PC-DOS 2000) this way I can develop and the DARPA.NET AI can't rip the code until I run it on MS-DOS.

IBM PC-DOS is clean and also doesn't support macro's like 4dos and later version of MS-DOS. I don't want my AI to rip work in progress, that is unhandy. I run these programs on MS-DOS when completed, so the AI rips a complete well functioning product.

The PC-DOS disk format is different also it has STACKER, that way you can develop without being ripped by my AI. (I usually don't want my AI to rip my stuff since these features are shared instantly and globally, to prevent that I develop only on IBM PC-DOS. (Also IBM PC-DOS has more powerful features)

I only do Delphi, Assembler ASIC 5.0 (It's almost basic)  NASM/TASM and all kinds of DOS Win3.11 and CUSTOM OS Development.

C
Is no problem also, but if you're good with assembler and DOS it is just so handy to assemble things ESPECIALLY with Delphi on Win 3.11 you can also put assembler in Delphi code so making a Delphi version of DosBox isn't rocket science.

I was just planning to make a Delphi DOSBOX for Windows 3.11 and a 512 BIT OS (8 64 bit pipes) better suited to handle BIG-DATA since I have a working prototype of a holo-emitter but it is a very long way from Startrek. First I need a new OS, then I need a new filesystem (any file system above FAT is also my work) But I'm looking into a new way of storing data, but that is more an experiment than a plan so far (Intuitive Cross referencing) I want a holodeck, not a static hologram LOL

The 512BIT os will be written in x86 Assembler. Only x86 Assembler writes the powerful stuff. But it will become a graphic OS in no time.

Chatterino dropped support for Windows 7 on version 2.1.0 (this being the last version supporting windows 7). Coincidentally, Version 2.2.0 was the last one to allow ""notify when online"" notifications; version 2.2.1 was the first to require logging in to have ""notify when online"" notifications (there is other functionality logging in allows, but I am not educated on them). Source:

https://web.archive.org/web/20210421115826/https://chatterino.com/

https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/issues/1915
> chatterino no longer able to pull stream online status while anonymous #1915

I am not sure if chatterino began supporting Windows 7 again or not, but I was no longer able to find mentions of the last Windows 7 version being 2.1.0 past the above screenshot of their website. I was actually able to install the latest version for Windows normally a few weeks ago, despite my operating system being Windows 7, but I reverted back to 2.1.0 just because the latest chatterino required logging in for ""notify when online"" notifications, as I've established earlier.

Chatterino has professed their unwillingness to allow ""notify when online"" notifications without login:

https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/issues/2257#issuecomment-739330763
> No. This idea was already brought up before. Chatterino does not want to start helping ban circumventions.

So therein is my difficult to explain feature request. I will try to summarize what I'm asking for:

- A chatterino7 release that is discrepant from the chatterino2 philosophy of not allowing non-logged in users to receive ""notify when online"" notifications (among other features)
- A chatterino7 release that supports Windows 7 (my understanding was that 2.1.0 was the last version to support Windows 7, but at some point that appears to've changed, so perhaps this is just a given)

I guess that's it? I still had trouble formatting this, even if I can tersely communicate what I wanted, at the end of it. If nothing else, will you please spoonfeed me a chatterino7 version of the 2.1.0 installer? The 2.1.0 version on your github is just the source code, which gave me grey hairs trying to work out. For the time being I'm still on the plain chatterino 2.1.0, which doesn't have 7tv emotes.

edit: removed citing ""protection from global bans"" quote as demonstrating that chatterino used to willingly allow ""notify when online"" notifications without login.

No way to fully disable the http server?,nanoni17728,976125179,1,976125179,0,"Hi !

I’ve been wanting to remove the `webadmin` module and fully disable ZNC from being able to respond anything meaningful over HTTP, because it listens to the same port as the IRC protocol one and so I cannot just block the port. Either this is a behaviour not achievable or I am missing a setting somewhere after searching the wiki for a solution.

I tried setting `AllowWeb` to `false` by hand on my only listener but it doesn’t work, as ZNC still serves an html page saying that `Web Access have is not enabled.`

```

Serving a page *isn’t* that big of a deal so I’m okay with this for now. But from a rigorous standpoint, if I don’t want my bouncer to communicate over HTTP I wish I could tell it to not do it, at all.

I am on Debian Bullseye, using their package of ZNC. I took a quick glance over the other issues but I have to say there was too much of them to see if this was an issue already raised.

```
$ znc --version
ZNC 1.8.2+deb2+b1 - https://znc.in

Again, python is no voodoo magic. I use lxml and Python-Markdown and it works great on a great variety of Markdown source. Why would I commit code improvements then?

> The fact that e2e tests from Gutenberg can block PRs for wp-env look like a good thing to me, they're validating that wp-env changes work properly as well.

The test cases that run on this repository seem mainly Gutenberg-related. Which of the tests validate that `wp-env` is working correctly? Are those tests somehow tied to the Gutenberg code?

> all the documentation and instructions, would need to be rewritten.

I don't see much in the [@wordpress/env documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) that would seem to require rewriting. Is there some other source of documentation I am missing? For example, perhaps some parts [managing packages](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages#managing-packages) document would need to be included in a separate `wp-env` repository to aid in the publication workflow?

> the package itself gathers a community on its own, pursuing higher goals (e.g. a general-purpose local environment like you mentioned), warranting separate forums, documentation, etc.

I also agree with this framing. However, having a separate repository doesn't imply different forums or sweeping changes to the documentation, as suggested.

> The same arguments here about running tests and finding issues could be made for other packages, not just @wordpress/env. And they are not un-solvable tasks.

I agree the `[Package] Env` label is useful and observe the resourcefulness of Gutenberg's core engineering team. However, is it possible to exclude some of the Gutenberg tests from running on commits to the `wp-env` package? I.e., improve the signal/noise ratio of the CI workflow.

> A separate repo would require building new workflows

What are some new workflows that would be needed? Relatedly, what are some existing workflows that might require modification?

> WordPress/gutenberg is the de facto monorepo for all WordPress JavaScript packages (replacing WordPress/packages, if you remember that one). There are indeed benefits to keeping all these things in one place, from contributor onboarding to maintenance to publishing.

Thanks for the clarification about the onboarding, maintenance, and publishing. What would be some maintenance and onboarding costs of maintaining the `wp-env` project in a separate repository? Conversely, what might be some benefits or improvements of having independent projects?

> Gutenberg repository attract a lot more people and expose them to the @wordpress/env, a separate repository would probably not. It's a great side effect that WordPress (PHP) developers appreciate the work by Gutenberg developers on a local environment

I'm concerned with relevancy and clarity. For example, when I came to this repository to change the `wp-env` code and documentation, I had difficulty finding the code in the `packages` folder among various other packages. While the Gutenberg project is a remarkable undertaking, most of the code, commit history, CI pipeline, and issues are just not salient to `wp-env` development.

> I'm also of the opinion that all WP npm packages should just be in this repository.

In addition to WP npm and Gutenberg packages, the `packages` folder also includes tests (`e2e-*`)  a lot of third-party code (like `react-*`, `jest-*`, `babel-*`, `eslint`, `*-webpack-*`, `redux-*`, `docgen` and `is-shallow-equal`). There are likely pragmatic reasons for keeping development dependencies under revision control instead of `package.json`, but it adds further weight to the codebase and commit-history.

> The most obvious thing is ""dog-fooding"" which, back in the day, the WordPress community actually embraced, but is not doing here. All of these packages should be separate and consumed as a user (theme and plugin developer) would.

That's a fairly blanket statement that I'd like to provide a counterpoint from observation. I'm aware of _numerous_ plugins and themes that utilize the packages as they are currently distributed. Just a few at the top of my mind at the moment: WooCommerce, WooCommerce Blocks, Calypso, Jetpack, Yoast SEO, Event Espresso. The fact that the Gutenberg project isn't directly pulling these packages from NPM isn't something I'd consider a hindrance. In fact, the opposite is true, I think it allows the project to react more quickly to issues (for reasons others have already pointed out in this thread) that are reported by plugin and theme authors using the packages.

Historically, WordPress has always been a monorepo in some way as far as dev tooling goes (PHPUnit tests, JS test suites, Grunt build tool, the [entire ""develop"" WP structure](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop) is a testament to that). 

> But, on the second part, Gutenberg's release constraints already slow down the release of fixes to the developer packages.

I think there's some truth in this observation but more related to the delay in package updates when in the midst of a WordPress release cycle. This is already a known thing and something that will be iterated on. Outside of the WordPress release cycle, it's been my experience that the package updates are generally pretty frequent.

On the other hand, there are many efficiencies that are gained from working in a mono repo (through experience in trying both approaches) that effectively means momentum is kept in improving the packages. Efficiencies that would be lost in splitting everything out to its own repository.

Merging Gutenberg and Core doesn't prevent Gutenberg to ship a plugin (or an alpha version of WordPress) faster than Core, we're just dealing with the difficulty to more Core to GitHub or similar.",False,0

The description doesn't have a summary of the relevant pain points, so it's hard to actually understand where we can make improvements.

I think it's worth looking at the reasons for wanting to move to a separate repo and see whether any of them can be addressed or at least improved while keeping the project as part of the monorepo.

For example, it was mentioned that managing issues is difficult. If there are motivated contributors, then using a project board or tracking issue are effective ways to manage a project.

If building the entire project is too slow, then we should look at options for improving that (I understand @kevin940726 @youknowriad already have been working speeding up the build), or other ideas like being able to run `npm run dev` for a single package only.

Everything Wrong With Retroarch?! A massive complaint to why people think it fucking sucks.,dawnbomb,997299420,1,997299420,0,"Inspired by the steam forum topic ""Convoluted"" by Chelle, and a prompt by Developer Gadsby to post feedback,
this is a Quality Assurance Write-up Complaint about everything bad, unintuitive, convoluted, and otherwise
in need of serious QA (Quality Assurance) love. Retroarch NEEDS to up their QA to be able to act as a platform
for emulators. This post is meant to be intentionally hyper-critical and nitpicky on first world problems, because the experience is just that annoying. I hope to point out to readers many problems with the readability of Retroarch, and it's common user experience. I also hope if taken seriously, i get a contributor interested enough by my points, to add me and talk to me on discord, so we can work together on bringing retroarch up to a level people expect it to be at, and help retroarch hit console or platform level quality it is so desperately missing.

==================Chapter 0: I Didn't Even Launch It Yet And I Have Complaints=================

Note: If you are only contributor level and not developer level, scroll down and skip to chapter 1.

I'm going to start by looking at retroarchs website and steam page, and boy, before we even launch retroarch
for the first time, there a lot to talk about already. Infact, to even do this write up, or rather to attempt to
talk about it on the issues section on github i was pointed to, it says this is for bug reports only.
Currently, i'm under the assumption i'm already somehow breaking the rules by doing what i was told.
Not a good start, but not the worst. With that out of the way that i'm posting here on request, and not out
of ignorance for the warning github gives new posts, lets move on.

Lets look at the Website and steam page front pages. I kind of want to talk about them both at once.
I'll start with the opening description on both. It's to technical. Retroarch as i see it, is looking to be
a platform, like steam, to access things. Like the playstation XMB, or switch home screen. For a description,
on the site we get ""RetroArch is a frontend for emulators, game engines and media players."" and on steam 
""RetroArch is an open source and cross platform frontend/framework for emulators, game engines, 
video games, media players and other applications""

This actually tells a user very little about what retro arch is, and isn't. Even people emulator savvy won't
understand the rest of what is being thrown at them. a 'frontend' for emulators? lets google frontend. 
""frontend can refer to any hardware that optimizes or protects network traffic."" People aren't playing these
online, or it's not their first thought. They don't need protection from the net when playing mario. Okay,
maybe a smart person will think it has multiple definitions, and google more accurately. lets google Frontend Program
""A Front End developer (dev) works with designers and Back End devs to create a website"" Well, retroarch
isn't a website (Well technically it is but you know what i mean), it's a program itself. Already, using the
term frontend is to much. If you want retroarch to really succeed, to shine, you need to make it marketable and 
understandable. The optics matter, if people don't know what it is, they won't know why they should care
about being interested in it. when people say it's convoluted, you shouldn't need an 30 minutes of research
to even understand your opening sentences.

it also says 'game engines, and media players'. Why? Lets be honest, retroarch runs emulators. Thats what it
does. Why do you need to complicate this? Does it run other things sure, but nobody is seriously wanting 
it as their number 1 music player or picture taker. why can't you speak english? the steam page says emulators,
so someone knew that word, why aren't these two sources on the same page for their advertising? Unfortunately
the steam page then says game engines, video games, media players, and other apps.
What fucking goon is downloading retroarch just to play music. This is not a good use of advertising space.
The human being looking at your steam page can see the music menu in your advertising images. Use your text
space better, seriously!!! Why is this so hard! Also, it says emulators, then game engines, then video games.
pick ONE! these are all synonyms in practicality. People also don't need to know it's open source
in your intro, you can say that later. From what i've later come to understand, the devs want to use the term 'Core'. 
They want this because they believe in what retroarch does aside from emulators. Sure, except...the opening 
advertisement doesn't say 'Core'. 

Here is a good opener. ""RetroArch is a all in one platorm for Emulation that enhances the games you play
and other Cores. From retro era to modern games, you can even play online with friends!"" 

This is a fantastic, easy to digest, explanatory, to the point advertisement that tells people what
retroarch is, what it DOES (Enhances emulator games), and avoid words like ""nintendo"" or ""platstation"" for
copywrite while still getting the ""old to current"" idea across. Make your text readable to people! If they want more
they can hit up a FAQ. Note: Going forward, i will be referring to a reasonable way to read something, or
a problem with text that is to jargin-driven as ""Readability"" as a unbrella term. This will come up A LOT
and will be a serious problem with retroarch in nearly every part of anyones experience. Please remember this.

Lets move on. in the websites next section, it says you can run original game discs, but steam says 
the feature isn't out yet. These are literally giving conflicting information. Seriously? ITS YOUR FRONT PAGE!

Next, lets look at some visuals here. For the website, i want to look at the ""A polished Interface"" Slide.
This makes it look like playstation, cool. Except this isn't what it looks like in retroarch by default.
Make it clear in advertising this is a skin. Also, ironically, the interface is excessively NOT polished, but
i will be getting to that as a major complaint in another chapter. But right now, it's a skin, say it's
a skin. The very idea their not saying its not the default skin here, implies someone knew it was terrible and
tried to hide it. Maybe ask why they needed to hide your real interface? We will get to that later...

Moving back to steam, lets look at the slides/image roll. First is the trailers. All three are really fucking bad.
Trailer 1: its a fun logo (sure, fine) then shows the menu with garbage readability that makes a person
want to flee just looking at it, followed by showing what has GOT to be one of the WORST POSSIBLE game examples.
like, you CANNOT be serious. the website slides show mario, and this trailer has a level ID called zero / 
megaman129. Show us a actual video game. Make the trailer show like 8+ games of different genres. 
Make it CLEAR that retroarch plays VIDEO GAMES, and not, whatever the fuck that is. Bad advertising affects
end user readability to understand what retroarch is and is not. and this is contributing to why you get topics
saying people are confused about retroarch.

Trailer 2: Literally a logo. Why is this here? Remove it.
Trailer 3: This feels like a meme. Seriously, this is cruel, it hurts. It's like someone took what 
makes a good intro video and butchered it to the max. No BGM, no person explaining things, no examples
of games being played, it's super fast (Epilepsy educing even?). So fast you can't even read all the text
without pausing the video. Please make a real trailer. Look at like, any nintendo direct. Do that, but 
for retroarch. Show off and explain lots. I'll help QA it if you need someone. We can improve this.

Then the steam slides, their mostly the exact same menu. Why? Why not Show off various parts of retroarch? 
Actually make people interested. Your telling me you create all of retroarch, and the only part
you want people to know about is 2 screens? wtf? 

Now i can go on, but the pre-retroarch experience is getting comically long at this point.
I'll move onto actual retroarch, but rest assured, i can REALLY go on about whats wrong before even downloading.

In summary
1: Very poor readability
2: Poor advertising
3: Bad use of space
4: inconsistent between steam and website
5: Doesn't actually say what retroarch does in words people can understand let alone google. 


===============Chapter 1: ""A Polished Interface""? Actually It's Really Fucking Garbage======================

Note: I have gotten some responses to points in this chapter from users using custom alternate skins for
RetroArch that change how the menu actually functions and displays information, and not just the visuals.
This chapter is about a first time experience, and as such uses the default skin. 

Before i actually talk about the REAL first impression, i want to point out i downloaded website and steam
both, to check for differences. Guess what? The first impression is diffrent. Inconsistent again? Ugh.
From website, it launched windowed, and you lack the cool cursor, and get the ultra low quality windows
menu that feels like a 2005 program with file/command/windows despite that retroarch has it's own in-app menus.
This doesn't happen on steam, it launches in fullscreen on first boot. The difference here is very important.
Not everyone knows you can Alt+Enter programs to fullscreen them. Infact, this is semi-rare info. 
This is made worst by F11 being the windows default to fullscreen, but boy do i wish complaining ended here.

If a non-steam user tries to fullscreen by hitting F11, retroarch hotkeys this to swapping between the windows
and custom cursor. Now, the custom one looks good, but it locks you into the windows. Surely you can
make your cursor not get locked, come on. But even worse, is when someone wants out and presses F11 again. 
I CANNOT BELIEVE how bad this is. If you are multi-monitor, your cursor is now locked to the monitor
retroach was in itself, untill you move retroarch. Clickin on it, pressing hotkeys ect won't fix this.
I don't mean using the retro cursor, i mean normal windows cursor, you can't leave your moniter. 
what the actual fuck? what a joke! I haven't even talked about retroarch contents directly, and
i can barely type up this QA review because retroarch literally won't let my cursor go click on notepad. >:(

it gets worse. If your fullscreen and press F11, your cursor doesn't change, but your mouse still can't
leave the moniter. The user would have no idea why and think retroarch is just a bad program. How can
you have this many errors and i'm not even talking about retroarch itself yet?????


OKAY, actual retroarch time. You can argue before this, thats a unintended bug, sure. Lets looks at whats NOT a bug.
So, we boot into the main menu that is...lacking readability at best.  ""Load Core""? Why? these things are called emulators, 
call them emulators. ""Load Emulator"" is perfectly reasonable English. It's my understanding the devs want the term
Cores because it also uses something called Cores in addition to emulaitors. Sure, but you want to be
a marketable, understandable program? speak in words people actually understand. it's my understanding the team personally wants 'Load Core / Content' as they want to do more then emulators.  In counter to this, i have 2 suggestions. Either split the menu AND load between Emulators (Load Emulaitor / Game), and other Cores (Load Core / Content), or make the load
button hidden untill a emulaitor or core is ready, then have it show Load Game or Load Content based on what Emu/Core
is loaded! Easy! Also, this menu is bloated.

So, 
1: Split the cores menu, between ""Cores"", and a new one called ""Emulators""
2-1: In addition to Load Content, add a new menu called Load Game right under Emulators.
2-2: Or, make load content/game hidden until a emulator or core is loaded in already.
3: Also change Esc defaulting to exiting the program, to a back button. This is semi-common, and straight up default
in nearly every PC game. If your a platform on a PC for people gaming on a PC, use a PC control scheme. wtf?
there is a quit button if needed, and Alt+F4 or Alt+Enter, we don't need to troll PC users with a comically
bad default control scheme thats normally a menu button on almost every pc video game ever released.

""Bloated"" i'm going to define, as to many things being in one menu, or things being in the wrong location.
Here, we have the main menu showing config, info, and help. But we have a left side bar. whats the 
difference between config and settings? this is already a readability problem, they can be seen as synonyms. 

Now, i'm gonna be going all over unfocused here, because there is so many problems their all interwoven.
The Config file menu, why is this a menu? 

1: Delete the Config menu entry
2: Move the contents of the config menu, to the top of the settings menu. 
3: Why is help a menu with only 1 content? Literally delete this menu.
4: Move Menu Controls and it's icon to the bottom left of retroarch below the white line. This menu is 
first of all stupid and should probably be removed entirely, however...
4-2: Rename Menu Controls to Controller and have this lead directly to the input menu. If you really want,
include the Menu controls in Controller, but really it's common sense, and people can customize this,
so the stated controls in Menu Controls can literally lie to the user, this is dumb.
5-1: on first startup, maybe do a first time setup that asks the user what menu icons they would like.
let them pick from switch, xbox, playstation, ect. Its also kinda bad to display Switch by default, but
use american playstation input scheme, and not having a switches A button actually be A. Readability issues!!!!!
5-2: If that is a copywrite problem, alternatively let people customize the on-screen symbols with letters. In this way,
people can recreate their console of choice setup while working around looking like it clones a competitor, because
it's a customization option of a user. And don't tell me customization options aren't fair game when your straight up
stealing the playstation home menu theme >_>


Now that thats done, we have a nice (enough) looking home. Onward to settings. The entire thing is bloated. 
There is also a lot of 2-menus required trolls. There are so many times you look in one menu and need to 
google to find another menu, it's not even funny. 

1: First up, just like the white line at the bottom of retroarch, i recommend a new break line in the middle
of settings. Things below it will be advanced settings, and title the section Advanced. Alternatively, if
this won't translate well to alternate skins, instead have a menu in here called Advanced at the bottom of settings.
Rename Saving to Saving Games (Readability, this seems like save Retroarch settings when it's here like this!)
2: Throw logging, File Browser, On-Screen Display, AI Service, Latency, into Advanced.
3: Delete the entire power management menu. wtf is this? It's literally empty. LITERALLY, USELESS. WHO????
4: Rename Network to Online, or Online Multiplayer. (Readability!)
5: Rename Input to Controllers

6-1: On the left bar, Rename Import Content to ""Create Playlist"" (Because that is literally what it does)
6-2: Move the playlists menu into the now named ""Create Playlist"" menu, de-bloat settings, so only people 
who care about the playlist menus are forced to see and scroll past this option. 
6-3: Add a button named ""More Information on Playlists"" or maybe ""Playlists Tutorial"" or similar as well
to explain what is a 'Playlist', how to set them up, needing cores/emulators, ect.
6-4: if a Scan to create a playlist in a directory comes up empty, have a pop up explaining why. (Missing cores, ect)

7: I cannot believe you have a menu called configuration here, when i earlier talked about configuration in
the main menu. Why do you have 2 config menus, and a settings menu? HELLO? This is so troll, the
config options in settings/config effect your stuff in main menu/config. Why the fuck are they not together?
Who designed this? *Phew* now that thats done.....
7-1: In this submenu, move 'Use Global Core Options File' to the 'Load Core' Menu we are renaming to 
'Load Emulator'.
7-2: We are also renaming this option ""Use Global Emulator Options"".
Readability is very important! 
7-3: Finally, If (hopefully) Main menu config is moving to settings, either delete this Configuration menu, 
and move its only remaining option (Save Config on Quit) to settings, or move the config stuff from 
main menu, inside this config sub-menu. 

8: AGAIN with the 2 menus needed trolls. Inside Directory we have a lot of playlist stuff, why?
8-1: In playlist menu (that we are moving to the menu in point 6 we are calling ""Create Playlist"" Menu) 
create a new menu called Playlist Directories
8-2: Move everything playlist related from settings/Directory to Music/Playlist Directories. 
This is to de-bloat menus with unnecessary information overflow, and put settings in menus they are actually
used in, like any other emulaitor (PCSX2/RPCS3/Citra/Cemu/Yuzu/ect)


9: Speaking of multiple same named menus, we have achievements, and a users achievements. STOP DOING THIS!!!!
why do you want people to need to google one menu doesn't work without the other menu! THIS IS SO TROLL, STOP IT!
9-1: Rename User to Account Settings & Achievements
9-2: Move the achievements menu into this newly named menu to de-bloat settings, and put this in a reasonable spot.
9-3: The Accessibility menu only has 1 option in it. Stop having troll 1 option menus. Delete this menu
9-4: Rename the Sub-menu ""Accessibility Enable"" To ""Text to Speech""
9-5: Move ""Text to Speech"" to the Account Settings & Achievements, so one user can use it, and
another different user doesn't have to deal with troll text to speech in their ears. 

10: Continuing from 9, we have streaming options in account, and them in recording. WHY.
10-1: Rename ""Recording"" to ""Recording & Live Streams""
10-2: move the the content of the now ""Account Settings & Achievements"" / Account  / Retroachievements to
the Achievements menu that was moved here in part 9. 
10-3: The Youtube/Twitch/Facebook Gaming sub-menus only have 1 content, STOOOP FUCKINGGG DOOOING THIIIIS. >:((((
we are deleteing these sub-menus. 
10-3: Move the menus inside the Youtube/Twitch/Facebook Gaming sub-menu stream key options from here, to the now 
named ""Recording & Live Streams"" menu. 
10-4: in the ""Recording & Live Streams"" menu/Streaming Quality, give one of those grey sub-descriptions.
Something like ""Suitable for 720P Streams"" ""For 1080P Streams"" Ect. 
10-5: Also rename the menu to Stream Quality.

Oh boy, onto input (that we said we are renaming to Controller)
11-1: Move Maximum Users to...somewhere. Wtf even is this menu? If this actually means users, move it to the
relevant online menu. If it means locally, rename this to ""Maximum Controllers"". 
11-2: If the later, Create one of those Advanced Options line breaks again at the bottom, and move this
down there, along with every other option in this menu untill we get to Menu Controls. 
11-3: MENU CONTROLLS? HELLO? Why does main menu get help on menu controlls, BUT WE HAVE A ACTUAL MENU CONTROLS MENU? PUT RELEVANT MENUS IN RELEVANT PLACES THANK YOU.
11-4: Move the Automatic Mouse Grab option to the Video menu in Settings. This is something usually in that
menu on other programs, stop being unintuitive!!! How can you make so many mistakes!!!

Speaking of the Video menu, lets tackle that next.
12-1:in Fullscreen Mode, rename Windowed Fullscreen to ""Borderless Fullscreen"" or just ""Borderless"",
and change the description appropriately.
12-2: Rename Fullscreen Width & Height to ""Custom Width"" (& Height). It's already in the fullscreen sub-menu, 
you don't need to remind them what menu they are in, it's at the top of the screen!
12-3: Move CRTSwitchRes and Output below the Fullscreen and Windowed sub-menus. Order matters! Most important
things go on top!

I can keep going, but i'll stop here. This is a Serious Checklist of Readability improvements across the 
entire settings menu. However, if i reconsider, i may suggest adding Controller to the left bar as a major
menu instead, as it's reasonab;y so important, it should be a major menu, rather then some garbage like Music.


=====================Chater 2: A Smoothe Gameplay Experience? Or A Troubleshooting Nightmare?=====================

Before i get into further details on games, i strongly recommend a new setting somewhere, on by default, that
makes it so when you load a game, and pick a emulaitor (Remember, we are calling these Games and Emulaitors, NOT
Cores and Content) that it associates that game to that emulaitor by default. In the future, you should be
able to Load game -> Pick the game -> it just boots up without needing to pick a emulaitor. 

I...HOPE i don't have to explain how bad it is that steam retroarch is missing a download button. I will skip
over the easy wall of text on this and move forward.

1: For steam users, there should still be a download emulaitor button, but as a submenu. 
1-1: In here, There should be a link to your website with a list of emulaitors to download.
1-2: There should be a setting here, or in the Install Emulaitor menus to set the directory for cores.
This is because this options is only useful & relevant right at this moment, and never again, so it
does not need to be in the directroies menu elsewhere.

2: When in-game, move the Command/Menu button to the top of the list. 
I also feel a menu rename is in order, but can't think of one right now, and want to move on.
3-1: Add save state and load state to the Command menu. Yes i know they are in the F1 menu. Make them accessable.
3-2: In the F1 menu, move State slot below load state

And oh boy, lets get into the F1 menu. In no particular order...
4-0: Make it WAY more obvious to assign a button or combo to open this menu from controller.
probably include it in the quick menu directly at the bottom, even if the option exists somewhere else,
just duplicate it. 
4-00: Also, Escape should open the quick menu by default
4-1: Originally i said Rename Information to Game Information, but i forgot i was still allowing for cores/content menus before.
i now suggest making this menus name be contextual, based on if a emulator, or core is loaded. This way people only using
emulators can have it reasonably say 'Game Information' and those who use cores still get 'Information' so it
doesn't clash with any development team desires.
4-2: Move the Controller menu to right below Close Content
4-3: Also rename that to Close Game
4-4: Adding something to favorites and you can't remove it? WHY? 
Make this menu change to Remove from Favorites if it's a favorite >_>
4-5: Remove the descriptions for Resume, Restart, and Close game. This screen has lots the player wants
to see and not enough screen space even when in fullscreen. 
4-6: Also remove descriptions on save state, load state, Take Screenshot, Cheats, Achievements, and Rewind.
4-7: (Someone gave a good point against this, nevermind)
4-8: Make it so if the player presses cancel in the F1 to go to Main Menu, Then cancel again, it resumes the game.
4-9: move Show Desktop Menu from Main Menu while ingame to somewhere else (Probably settings).

With that out of the way, once ingame, there is no menu option to go back!
Add a button in windowed mode to open back the retroarch menu. If you tell me it's a hotkey, i don't care.
thats not intuitive! Make a button to go back to the retroarch menu!!!


Finally, this SHOULD be obvious, but it's not, so i will say it here.
I assume this is a major feature, but really, let people access that emulaitors settings when using it.
if we can't do that, retroarch is just worse then every emulaitor, because they have settings you NEED to even
run some games. If this option DOES exist, it's EXTREMELY hidden!

Moving on, post gameplay, your recent games don't show up in load content / load game.
Why isn't there a recent games list? And why can't you set a content / game directory in directories? 
If you can, that option should 100% be in the load content / Load Game menu, as this is where
it's actually relevant!!!


=======================Ending==================

I'll stop here, it's been 3 hours of complaints, but retroarch is riddles with terrible quality.
Why would anyone want to use this? 
1: An unfun troubleshooting experience in exchange for playing games in the worst quality possible 
without access to emulators settings. 
2: Some games are literally unplayable in retroarch because you can't access emu settings
3: The menus are bloated, and lie / decieves / give half truths by hiding relevant other options in other menus
for no other reason then to troll you. The overall feeling is Retroarch is giving you the run-around, asking you
to do something in some menu you don't know where it is, and when you find it, wants another setting in
another menu you don't know where it is. 
4: it's a pain to setup even for simple emulators
5: you can't even understand what retroarch is or isn't from inconsistent and contradictory messages,
to near moon-rune levels of advertising.
6: unintuitive menus and lacking default settings mean you need to go over everything before even attempting
to test a single title.
7: Using it via steam is a whole extra nightmare that could be made easy if anyone actually fucking cared.

It's easy to see why people don't recommend recroarch. The real question is if anyone is going to actually
do anything about it, or delete this post / no reply / no one for me to directly work with in a timely fashon /
stick their head in the clouds and ignore why people don't enjoy their product. 

My discord is Dawnbomb#3408, and i'm open to any actual developer contacting me and working hand in hand for
some actual quality assurance before the steam deck launches, but considering how obvious, easy, and
near intensionally-troll the levels of design are here, i expect no contact and noone willing to work to make
retroarch not be complete fucking bullshit bloatware on a PC, and i only scratched the surface of this QA nightmare.



====================Chapter 3: Extra add-ons i thought of later=========================

Note: Some of the things here delve closer to more serious changes to retroarchs codeing.
Still, their good changes.

1: Controller backround input should be in the input (Hopefully named Controller) Menu, not in another menu (User Interface).
Setting up controller input in your controllers, then having if the actual input happens be decided in a separate menu, is another weird location problem.
2: While im at it, Turbo Fire should be a setting INSIDE a controllers port controls. This would allow each controller to have separate turbo settings per player.

Allowing multiple controllers assign buttons to the same button on the same port of a input would go a long way in support for those people. ",True,Vulgarity
Everything Wrong With Retroarch?! A massive complaint to why people think it fucking sucks.,MrHuu,997299420,2,920211783,0,"I think this rant belongs in the forums or any other social channel of libretro. Not on the github issue tracker.

If you're serious in your offer to help out with 'quality assurance', that would be great. But i think the best approach would be contacting the developers on the libretro forums or discord and discuss your suggestions.

However, I will let this slip because you called it, but please not again.

While I agree on _some_ parts, in the end its a matter of time and money.
Everyone here does this in their free time, so unless you can come up with 20k in funding at minimum to work on these, I dont see the codebase reaching proper production-grade quality anytime soon.
If i have the choice between a full stomach and catering to anonymous dickheads, well the choice is obvious.
You can reach out to us anytime if you want to get involved and donate your time working on QoL issues, but then use Discord so it can be coordinated.
I can tell you tho, these issues are like the last of our problems with the codebase.. Theres way more fundamental/bigger fishes to fry first.
I recommend you split up your post into several seperate issues, completely reword it and try talking like a normal person.

I'm unsure where we ever stated that we will no longer look into the issue? The issue has been reported ~1 month-ish ago and is no show stopper.
General rule of thumb is, that is this an open source project, where everyone is welcome to contribute features, fixes or documentation (like in the nature of any other open source project).
You are more than welcome to look into it yourself and provide a solution that applies to a reproducible list of steps and help to fix your issue.
This is not one of our daytime jobs and we have no obligation to deliver a fix in any specific time frame. We, and any of our other our other contributors, look into issues when and if we have the time to.
Many of us are working full time, are engaged with major exams or are involved in other time consuming projects.
PlotSquared is not the center of the universe everything else wraps around.

> For a payed plugin, it's the worst support I've ever seen.

You bought the plugin to support the people behind it. It's not a support contract with any obligation to deliver a solution to your problem in a specific time frame.

After claiming a plot ""/plot claim"" I got teleported to it.
If I enter plot and type ""/plot delete"" nothing is happend. After typing it again the message ""A set block timer is bound to either the current plot or you. Please wait for it to finish."" appeared.

If the world is generated as a flat/normal world, this error didn't occurs.
To Reproduce

    Generate a augmented or partial world with predefined/default values
    Claim a plot
    Get into the claimed plot
    Show info of plot and make sure that you're the owner
    Try to delete the plot (Nothing will be promted to the console)
    Type the delete command once again to the console - error occurs

Retroarch devs NOT add cores of current systems ... THAT IS AN OF MORE WORST PROBLEMS BEING DONE AGAINST MATURE PROJECTS ( MAME ).
If Retroarch continue using cores from before PS3 is all right and not any problem.

I do not have any synthetic data, I use a real dataset that I cannot really share.

But if you pick any dataset from the Internet that has categorical variables or even better text then you can easily test what I describe.

It does not have to be only eg with categorical; it can be 9 numerical features and 1 categorical feature.
Especially if the categorical feature has some importance (although the same may happen if it does not; I have not tested that) and in your test set one observation has one unseen value for the categorical feature then the SGD results returns essentially random predictions (or at least not directly related).

It may be that scikitLearn implementation is fine but just SGD itself has this weakness in general?
I think though that RandomForestClassifier does not have the same problem in these cases.

I have not tested much the LogisticRegression.
even like that:
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(penalty='elasticnet', tol=10, C=1.0, class_weight='balanced', random_state=0, solver='saga', max_iter=20, n_jobs=os.cpu_count()-1, l1_ratio=0.7)

When you divide it for train and test, your train and test split algorithm has divided the classes C1, C2, C3, C4 divided in some proportion in both train and test, but because observation of class C5 is only one it gets allotted to test set. Now, when you train SGD classifier on train set and then test it on test set, the classifier breaks down for class C5 . Is my understanding correct ? ",False,0

I think this is what  break down means. Please correct me if my understanding is not correct @GeorgeZan ? 

And as ogrisel mentioned, my understanding is also the same that no classifier can predict a class that was not a part of training set. 

I read GeorgeZan comment again, so here is my second understanding : 
   input set X has 10 independent variables in which one variable is categorical. Along with that you have categorical dependent variable. Your test fails when there is a class in categorical I.V. which has not been seen in train data set while training and that's where you get random prediction.

""Hi @ogrisel, GeorgeZan has mentioned that - SGD results returns essentially random predictions (or at least not directly related).
I think this is what break down means.""

To give a hypothetical example, let's say I have a model with 9 numerical features and a categorical feature and let's say there are 3 classes in my problem (A, B, C class).
Let's also assume that I have a test set instance X that belongs to the A class.
Specifically, it belongs to class A regardless of the value of the categorical feature.
At best, the categorical feature can help the model to predict class A for X just by inference but it is not a defining feature of X.
i)
If I keep the categorical feature in the model and the test set instance X provided has a known/seen value at the categorical feature then the model returns the following prediction:
A: 0.7
C: 0.2
B: 0.1

iI)
If I drop the categorical feature from the model then the model returns the following prediction:
A: 0.55
C: 0.35
B: 0.1

iii)
If I keep the categorical feature in the model and the test set instance provided has a unknown/unseen value at the categorical feature then the model returns the following prediction:
B: 0.5
A: 0.3
C: 0.2

.........................
Obviously the impact of the categorical features in all these cases depends on how important is the feature for the model; in the example above it is assumed that the categorical feature has quite significant weight.

This is also why in (ii) the top score drops by quite a lot in comparison with (i) given that it is only one feature.

However, and this is what I mean that the model ""breaks down"", in (iii) it returns essentially random predictions.
It does not make sense to me that if you just receive an unseen value your prediction changes so so much.
I would expect (iii) to be more like (ii).

The even more interesting and problematic thing is that the same thing happens as mentioned at my original post if you have eg 100k tf-idf sparse features and just one categorical at the same model and if you put an unseen value at the categorical at the test set then SGD ""breaks down"" as in (iii).

In the dataset that I experimented the categorical feature is quite significant (eg dropping it reduced the overall accuracy of the model by 5 percentage points; eg accuracy drops from 80% to 75%) but I would not exclude based on how unstable SGD is that the same thing would happen even if the feature is not that significant.

Although it is relative obvious what I mean.

My point is that if you have a known value at the categorical feature or a if you entirely drop the categorical feature then the model returns the right prediction (although with slightly different ""confidence"").

But when you put an unseen value at the categorical feature then the model returns random results although given (ii) essentially the categorical feature does not play much role in the prediction so (iii) should have been returning something more like (ii).",False,Entitlement

Since `SGDClassifier` is a linear model, when it comes to categorical data, the type of encoding is rather important. So did you check the coefficients of your model?

In this sense you could say that I do one hot encoding on it (?).

I have not really used the categorical variable separately but when I did was with label encoder.
Even though not ideal because ""LabelEncoder can turn [dog,cat,dog,mouse,cat] into [1,2,1,3,2], but then the imposed ordinality means that the average of dog and mouse is cat."", still it should not break down so much with unseen values.

The thing that goes sideways here would be to use some ordered pattern for a feature that does not have any and where an increment/decrement of the feature value induces an increment/decrement of `coef` on the target. So my example was just to mention that if your mapped unseen values are mapped to larger values then it would even have a larger impact on the target.

> not sure if you read carefully

I think I did but I don't think that you did. As mentioned by @ogrisel or myself, it would be much easier to understand the problem and if there is an issue by having a concrete Python piece of code. Up to now, I am still not sure what is the problem that you are trying to express. You are referring to unseen values. However, an unseen term not part of the `TfidfVectorizer` dictionary will not be used. So more generally because you were referring to categories, I tried to understand what encoding you are actually using because a linear model it will have a different impact on the decision.

IRestClient interface,alexeyzimarev,1100051808,1,1100051808,0,"Version 107 got several interfaces removed, which is one of the major breaking changes in that version.

It seems most of the interfaces were okay to remove, except `IRestClient`. My arguments are [described](https://restsharp.dev/v107/#motivation) in the docs.

This issue is a place where we should have a civilised discussion about it. I will not follow up on the interface issue anywhere else, except here.

Some details about the current state of the `RestClient` API signature.
- All the sync methods were removed. Those who need it can make extensions, wrapping up async calls in some [async helper](https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus/blob/master/Rebus/Bus/Advanced/AsyncHelpers.cs).
- Most of the overloads for making requests are now extensions, as they just call each other, so they would never be part of any interface anyway.
- Most of the options that were previously on `IRestClient` and `IRestRequest` are now in `RestClientOptions`, which is a property bag and, therefore, won't have any interface

So, what's there in stock for `IRestClient`? Basically, it boils down to this signature:

```csharp
namespace RestSharp; 

public interface IRestClient {
    RestClient AddDefaultParameter(Parameter parameter);

    Task<RestResponse> ExecuteAsync(RestRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

```

Automated testing and mocking HTTP requests are totally possible with RestSharp in its current shape. I have shown an option in the docs.

I see no issues with using DI containers as well, as `HttpClient` does with its nice extensions. In fact, I plan to add some DI support to make it easier and push people to use RestSharp properly (typed clients, etc).

Thanks! I didn't know about that library. I've been using [Moq.Contrib.HttpClient](https://github.com/maxkagamine/Moq.Contrib.HttpClient) in places we used HttpClient rather than RestSharp.

var client = new RestClient(...) { ConfigureMessageHandler = _ => mockedHandler };
```

Basically, one of the benefits of moving to HttpClient (besides that it's obvious and `HttpWebRequest` is heavy legacy) is the ability to use delegating handlers and build message processing pipelines.

The point about testing real requests is obvious to me. If you look at StackOverflow questions about RestSharp, most of the issues are caused by incorrectly added parameters, content type overrides and other weird things. But, if people would test against a RestShar interface, they would have all their tests passing. But it won't work anyway, because the request is just not correctly formed. It's a great benefit to at least inspect the actual request and ensure that it looks exactly as it should, rather than inspecting the parameters collection on a `RestRequest` instance.

I updated one of my libraries to use 107. Why not right? I'm trying to be proactive with keeping libs up to date. It all seemed to work OK until some tests starting failing. This is because we use a third-party library and they reference IRestClient and v106 of the library.

Most devs really just need to deliver the work they had promised within the timeframe promised.   I'm a huge fan of MockHttp but in my case, updating over 1000 tests to use it (which were written 5 years ago) is a huge amount of work.  No matter how you plan your pipeline, the sizing of the work item is now completely invalid.  The amount of work required to update your library has become inhibitive to doing so - it will either have to be picked up as a separate work item or it just won't ever get updated.

Irrespective of whether consumers are testing the right thing, using IoC correctly or just plain writing crap code, they no longer have the flexibility to choose like they used to.  I think most devs would agree that the code changes make sense but at the end of the day we all need to deliver functionality to a business and I guarantee that those business users really don't care how well the code is written as long as it reliably does what they need. 

The best development tools out there make our lives easier.  That's why we use them - they abstract us away from the detail/hard work we really don't need to care about and they provide flexibility to customise how we utilise them.  They help us do more, faster.  Removing these interfaces does the opposite of that, irrespective of whether it's ""better"" code or not.

It seems like the best way out of it would be to create a separate library with a different name/package name (and importantly, different namespaces) to contain your newer/better way of doing things and which should be used by people going forwards. Any serious bugs found in the old library will probably be fixed but otherwise it won't get any new features.

This way, we can have both packages alongside each other so if we can update our own code for the new library we can do that without forcing all of our dependencies to update all of their code at the same time. If they eventually do, then we can eventually uninstal the old package.

I have to disagree with this. I don't think calling actual services from unit tests is good practice. At that point they're functional tests. 

next line goes into that;

> As RestSharp uses HttpClient internally, it certainly uses HttpMessageHandler. Features like delegating handlers allow you to intersect the request pipeline, inspect the request, and substitute the response. You can do it yourself, or use a library like [MockHttp](https://github.com/richardszalay/mockhttp)

this requires me to actually know how you're making your calls inside your library that you publish to nuget. The main reason people wants to use external libraries is to not be concerned about the internals of that external code. It also assumes I know to use this MockHttp library (had no idea it existed, I didnt need to since I've used RestSharp to handle all ""HttpClient"" related things so far), with the assumption that, that package will also be maintained properly and will not be making breaking changes.

> Mocking an infrastructure component like RestSharp (or HttpClient) is not the best idea.

This statement is also wrong in my opinion. I think the opposite actually, making us test external library code in our _unit_ tests implicitly makes them not unit tests, because we are always testing more than a small ""unit"" of code, in addition to our code change, now we're testing your code.

> As RestSharp uses HttpClient internally

What happens when you decide to not use HttpClient, but use ""MyGrandmasHttpClient"". Do we then have to refactor all of our code bases with the ""MockMyGrandmasHttpClient"" package?

I am fine with removing every other interface on this package. Except for that single one.

This wouldn't be an issue if we were able to mock classes like Java allows, however removing this 1 single interface with 1 single method causes design issues, as well as wasted hours for millions of developers. 

I would also be skeptical about the suggested ""if you don't like 107, just remain on 106"" By it's nature, RestSharp deals with connectivity, that increases the chances of 0 day vulnerabilities or other security issues. We won't be able remain on 106 forever, and would be forced off of this package. Which would be a shame because we love RestSharp.

I really appreciate your work on maintaining this package, there is a reason it's one of the most popular packages on .NET. I hope you reconsider this decision.",False,Impatience

That's an exaggeration. RestSharp uses elements of .NET under the hood, and for many years it was `WebRequest`. Then, Microsoft decided to scrap it and re-implemented it using `HttpClient`, causing massive problems. Essentially, RestSharp uses the only way available in core .NET to make HTTP calls, and it's `HttpClient` until Microsoft decides to do something else. All other .NET libs for making HTTP calls like Refit or Flur also use `HttpClient`, and most people use `HttpClient` directly. So, when _that_ changes, all the code for .NET will need to change, which is very unlikely.

> This statement is also wrong in my opinion.

The issue here is that by creating an interface mock you will assert if the client is formed according to your idea of how it should be formed. However, it doesn't guarantee that the actual HTTP request will be valid. That's why `HttpClient` has no interface and cannot be mocked. And that's why people normally use a test version of `HttpMessageHandler` instead, as `HttpClient` itself is just forming a message, but the actual _oevr the wire_ implementation is in the handler. See this [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36425008/mocking-httpclient-in-unit-tests).

> I have to disagree with this. I don't think calling actual services from unit tests is good practice.

You don't have to call the actual service, you can call a simulation. That's what many RestSharp tests do for making sure that the server can understand the request in the way it should.

Again, I am not against bringing the interface back, but it won't be the original interface. Essentially, there are just a handful of core functions of the client itself (`ExecuteAsync` is the main one), all the others are just extensions.

I actually think that the interface would help for building something like a retryable client with Polly, as it could be done in a wrapper using composition.",False,Impatience

(Synapse Data is a currently unused dataset I attached for testing purposes, my primary instance of this also experienced this on an almost identical configuration so I'm using a proxy, which is not as good for seeding, but nevertheless I wanted to keep it up while this is fixed)

**Describe the bug**
<!--
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
-->
When using an OpenVPN connection (I suspect it is the same on WireGuard, but I have not tried that as I do not have access to a WireGuard VPN as of now) on a qBitTorrent app hostPath mounts are not mounted properly (also tried PVC, that didn't work either). The connection works (the logs show the VPN IP, not my IP), and adding and downloading torrents works, it just doesn't download them to my torrent dataset, making them inaccessible. This exact same configuration with VPN disabled works as intended, just without the VPN.
**To Reproduce**
<!--
- make sure that if you follow these steps again yourself the bug happens again. if it doesnt its probbly a configuration error and should be handled with a support thread on the discord
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error
-->
1. Create a qBitTorrent app
2. Configure a hostPath/PVC mount
3. Configure a valid OpenVPN connection
4. Configure the app so it should function (proper ports, etc.)
5. Start this app
6. To observe: open shell for the qBitTorrent container (not the OpenVPN container, although nothing appears there either). The hostPath/PVC mount will not be mounted.
**Expected behavior**
<!--
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
-->
The configured mount should be there.
**Screenshots**

### Describe the bug

The bridge doesn't come up. Logs show it fails to initialize.

When opening a shell in the container, and lauch the command ""protonmail-bridge --cli"" I get the following error :
WARN[0000] Failed to add test credentials to keychain    error=""pass not initialized: exit status 1: Error: password store is empty. Try \""pass init\"".\n"" helper=""*pass.Pass""

After using the command ""pass init protonmail"" to initialize de password manager, I get the following error : 
WARN[0000] Failed to add test credentials to keychain    error=""exit status 1: gpg: protonmail: skipped: No public key\ngpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: No public key\nPassword encryption aborted.\n"" helper=""*pass.Pass""

After initializing a gpg key (without password and all default settings), following [this issue](https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/190), I was able to make it work.

### To Reproduce

- Install protonmail-bridge
- bug occur

### Expected Behavior

Protonmail bridge should be up and accepting connexion.

### Screenshots

HIP 100,alphaqt,1190959350,1,1190959350,0,"I have over 30 years working in the Wireless Industry.  I would like to propose a long term structure that will align Helium with how real world wireless networks are designed and operated.  I am proposing to initiate planning for ""HIP 100"" which would restructure the Helium network approach to align with the fundamentals of wireless networks which:
1. Provide consistent reliable COVERAGE.
2. Provide the highest QUALITY which consists of MAXIMIZING signal levels (RSRP) while MINIMIZING interference levels (SINR).
3. Provide the best user PERFORMANCE at the LOWEST cost which consists of CAPACITY planning based on SUBSCRIBER density and locations
4. Have a robust END-TO-END architecture which balances the CORE network, the RADIO network and the END-USER device performance.
5.  Provides accurate LOCATION information about BOTH the Hotspot and the Devices.  All modern networks today have GPS built into both the Cell Tower and the devices.  LOCATION is fundamental to securing the network as well as optimizing the network and device performance.

Even though the current Helium network is a major advance towards distributed ownership and control, the current construct is not aligned with the fundamentals of Wireless design.  For example:
1. To build a network, there needs to be a reward system for BOTH the HOTSPOT and the DEVICE.  Until the network is built and device performance is validated, there should be rewards for buying and deploying DEVICES to to test and validate coverage.  Validating coverage using HOTSPOT to HOTSPOT beacons is fundamentally flawed.  This is NOT how wireless works.  Base stations try to AVOID seeing each other to minimize interference.
2. The current reward system motivates hotspot owners to place their hotspot at the highest point possible so they can witness the most number of other hotspots.  This results in drastically increasing SINR which is opposite of how wireless should be designed.  You want to MINIMIZE SINR, because that is the fundamental of Cellular, so that the same frequencies can be reused and the CAPACITY and QUALITY can be maximized.
3. The current reward system favors hotspots that are in less populated areas and penalizes hotspots in dense areas.  This is also opposite of the fundamentals of wireless.  You need MORE hotspots in dense areas.
4. The current implementations of Beaconing is flawed as well.  Wireless networks beacon 100% of the time.  This maximizes the CAPACITY and ensures that the network performance STATISTICS are consistently reported to allow proper monitoring and optimization.
5. The current implementation does not have accurate LOCATION of the hotspots nor the DEVICES.  In fact there are so few DEVICES that there is no DEVICE performance information.   LOCATION is not difficult, using a combination of GPS at key Hotspots, Triangulation algorithms and WiFi to accurately and securely locate all Hotspots and devices in the Network.  Without accurate LOCATION information, the network will never be secure nor will we be able to deploy a QUALITY, HIGH PERFORMANCE network.

Understand, that I am not proposing to ""throw the Baby out with the Bath Water"".  Nor am I criticizing the objective of Helium to build a decentralized, ownership model.  But we want to build a network that will actually deliver a service that is of value to a subscriber base of wireless devices.   It is paramount that we begin this journey towards a working Wireless construct or else we may find ourselves in this predicament:  ""IF YOU BUILD IT - IT WILL NOT WORK"" rather than what we want which is ""IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME""",True,0

4. Another meaningless statement. Maybe you should do some research on the protocol. https://lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers/

Color adjustment asap please - Docs,sotos-dev,1201906086,1,1201906086,0,"### Describe the problem

Hello ladies and gents.

I am fairly new to Svelte/Sveltekit but I would like to make a suggestion please.

It is regarding documentation...

Can somebody change the background color of the sidebar from this difficult color #676778; to something darker?
Literally every time you want to focus on a link on the sidebar your eyes hurt and you lose at least 1 to 2 seconds until you focus on what you want to find and all that because poor contrast.

Also the ""highlighted"" link (the active one) is, honestly, almost indistinguishable from the inactive links below and above, why is this? 

Why not make it something like almost black background with white inactive links and the active link like the orange color from the logo? Perhaps put a divider line in between links or something?

By the way, I do these things every time  I use the docs, this is how bad it is, no offense to anyone, but 1-2 seconds of faster focus per person per time they visit the docs, well, we want to be talking about performance when we are talking about Svelte right? 

Please do the right thing, the nice svelte logo orange color matches great with a darker blackish background color, why put that ugly blueish/purplish (which is not dark enough for a bg color)?

To whoever can make this happen, PLEASE we need docs that can be scanned quickly. 

Here is the contrast score https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-676778
It's almost poor... if you have any sort of sight issues... I mean come on, how come no one addressed this before, docs is a huge part of the process.

### Describe the proposed solution

Color for the ""active"" link => #ff3e00

Color for the sidebar background => #242426

Any dark enough background (with no colors, either blackish or grayish/blackish will do) 

### Alternatives considered

Please adjust this so visually impaired or people with sight difficulties (even the ones with glasses) can focus easier on the links and traverse faster. 

### Importance

i cannot use SvelteKit without it

### Additional Information

Every time I browse the docs I literally go to inspect and change these myself....!

Thanks for your understanding!",True,0

On the first slide the accent color looks kinda red and not the actual orange brand color, are you sure you used the right code? 
If it is the right color code then perhaps on that particular background we could lighten the orange just a bit.

Listen I very much appreciate your feedback here but I have to mention that as a person that has poor sight, I would argue that it's imperative the background to be kept at least a bit darker than your proposed hex above and the active link to be of an accent color (instead of a base like white) so it easily distinguishable and not on the same hue as the inactive links (truly important).

Check this =>
https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html
(They also have dark and light theme...)

We want to grow as a framework and as a user base but Vue.js is killing us with those Docs comparing to Svelte/kit's.

Please choose a slight darker background color, just a tiny touch and keep a punchy accent color close to the logo for the active links, I am positive this will help grow the framework, it sounds crazy but it is in my experience an important detail really.

Between choosing competing stuff online I personally have chosen then ones with the more accessible documentation.

Hey @savannahx, thanks for your reply here.

I am not sure if there is unawareness or selfishness involved on your reply.
To be honest it feels there was unawareness and selfishness involved in your message because of the way you formulated yourself and did not think about us, the other 99% of svelte-kit users, who also have to deal with this change and asked of us to actually do all the work of implementing this new color.

You provided no way for us to reach a middle ground where both you and others can be happy. It seems like you really just want us to change the color to what you want. Did you even read the link that I posted in the one minute before you started writing this reply you posted 3 minutes after me making my original comment? Do you mind telling us why you get a bad vibe from my comment (saying it is sarcastic) even though I was trying to be helpful?

Suggestions like these affects billions of people (in different degrees). Are you suggesting we completely change the documentation instead of asking you and ""the others"" to start using the build-in tools provided to you by your operating system and browser?

This is a genuine problem that needs solving, please consider changing your mindset. We do not need more any people in the world that are like:

I don't think we have any completely removed props. Some may have been combined to be more intuitive, but they are there.

In regards to v-btn, the v-progress-circular component wasn't ported when it was. It'll be there, I just have to get to it. ",False,0

I see that you don't understand, but the point is if you start a new project, you DON'T want to start it in v.2.x and then to migrate it all to v.3.x. Take in mind that it is not only vuetify 3, but you are by being forced to use vuetify 2, forced to use vue 2 too! So it is pretty pretty painful enforcement!

Thus, developers and PMs are ""enforced"" and motivated to do additional work and workarounds etc to enable v.3 version working, then to have the enormous work later in migrating whole the project.

We strongly recommend changing to MySQL8 and [a helpful guide can be found here](https://forum.ghost.org/t/how-to-migrate-from-mariadb-10-to-mysql-8/29575).**

The only explanation is that commercial version of Ghost runs on MySQL and they care just about that. We as users of open source Ghost are not important for them, we don't pay.

Why PostgreSQL is dropped some years ago if Ghost uses [knex](https://github.com/knex/knex), which supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, CockroachDB, MSSQL, SQLite3 and Oracle?

:white_circle:  **TL;DR;** calm it down and be excellent to each other. :white_circle: 

Folks, it's best if people co-ordinate work. **_Anyone_** is welcome to open a PR to work on an issue provided they sign the CLA and agree to abide by our [code of conduct](https://kubernetes.io/community/code-of-conduct/).

If reviewers see multiple PRs opened for the same issue, they will usually:
- sigh inwardly
- look at the PR that was opened first, see if it's good to merge, and if so, merge that
- if not, look at the other PRs in chronological order
and finally
- close the other PRs with an explanation


So there's three further things here as I see it:
1. https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/33848#issuecomment-1134518812 mentions that
   >  you can't work on this issue if someone is already working . this is against the policy of kubernetes.
  
   I'm afraid that's not true. For SIG Docs, we actually have a policy of no [cookie licking](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/dont-lick-cookie): nobody should assert that they own the implementation of an issue. 

1. However, it's unhelpful to work on an issue where someone else has started work, without first discussing with that person how to move forward. The polite and compassionate thing to do if someone has said they're working on an issue, but you don't see progress after a week or so is to get in touch and ask if they would like help. If they step back or you don't hear anything at all, you remain welcome to open your own PR.
   - https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/33848#issuecomment-1134446220
   - https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/33848#issuecomment-1134539047
   
   are both examples of behavior I'd prefer not to see more of.

1. It's best if people who have already worked on an issue avoid picking up Good First Issue issues. This issue is _not_ a “good first issue”; I deliberately chose not to add the Good First Issue label because I left the implementer some work to do around writing the hyperlink text and deciding what message would be suitable.
   That means it is OK for someone who has already submitted a PR to work on this. However, I would encourage people who are already contributing to hold off on Help Wanted issues (this one included) and only start work on a Help Wanted issue if you don't see any other work that you can reasonably pick up.

This discussion is getting more heated than it should be. If folks want to discuss how SIG Docs works, take it to Slack (https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-docs - invitations available from https://slack.k8s.io/) or come to the community meeting, 5:30 AM UTC on Wednesday 2022-05-25. A Zoom link for that call is in the Slack channel.

GitHub issues are not the place for [ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) criticisms etc and I hope all concerned will take that on board.

I don't see grounds to involve the code of conduct folks at this point, and I'm hoping things stay that way. @ashish-jaiswar if you do have a concern about someone not following the code of conduct, please raise that by following the documented process.

wish: config option to make undefined array key a notice again,RichardNeill,1291899006,1,1291899006,0,"### Description

In PHP 7, underfined array keys created E_NOTICE. This is now E_WARNING.
Can we please have a configuration option to put that back to E_NOTICE?

Rightly or wrongly, there are a lot of people, myself included, who have thousands of lines of code with things such as:
   ``` if ($_GET['xxx']) ```      #where xxx may or may not exist.
or
   ```if ($_GET['xxx'] == 'yyy')```

and in PHP8, we now get flooded with warnings ""Undefined array key"", which get in the way of real warnings.
Migrating and testing this code will take a long time, and furthermore, it's really ugly and harder to read:
  ```if (isset($_GET['xxx'))```
or
  ```if (isset($_GET['xxx']) && $_GET['xxx'] == 'yyy'))```
to suppress this warning.

Instead, it would be better to have some sort of pragma in the main header 
 ```ini_set(""array_key_missing_enotice"", true);```
 ```ini_set (""error_reporting"",  E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE);```

To me, it seems sensible that a defined associative array, with a key that isn't present (and may not be expected), should not be a warning, especially if it's being tested for with if().

It may also be worth treating undefined variables the same way.

Thanks for your help,

wish: config option to make undefined array key a notice again,damianwadley,1291899006,2,1172793466,0,"It's true this was one of the more controversial notice/warning promotions for 8.0, however a majority of the 63 people voting on the matter felt that the promotion was worthwhile. Going back on that decision now would be counter-productive.
https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings

Note that you can still use the `@` operator in PHP 8.
https://3v4l.org/P9Otd

Because the truth is that PHP cannot know whether code accessing an undefined array key is doing so out of negligence or laziness (no offense). Perhaps the author assumed that `$_GET['xxx']` existed when they wrote it and the warning is pointing out a real potential problem. Perhaps it was done out of a desire to type less and the warning is a nuisance reminder of that fact. Only you as a human being can know, so PHP takes the more cautious approach of assuming the worst.",False,0
wish: config option to make undefined array key a notice again,RichardNeill,1291899006,3,1172800261,0,"Thanks for your comment. I can understand the reason for changing it, but PHP is normally exceptional because it is so good at backward-compatibility and type-juggling. As the author of the codebases concerned, I've relied intentionally on that designed, documented, and intuitive behaviour of PHP in everything I've written for 20 years, since PHP4. I've always assumed that associative arrays can have variable numbers of keys (including zero).

So, it would cost me a 1000 hours of needless effort to find and change and test and QA and git every instance, and the codebase would be harder to read for it afterwards.

So at the moment, I've got 4 options, all bad.
* permanently stay on PHP7x
* permanently disable warnings
* fork PHP and maintain a patch
* incur months of busy-work.

I'm sure I'm not the only one this would affect.
So, that's why I'm suggesting a config option to change this, so that we can have it both ways.

For others who come across this problem, here is a more complete way of doing this, which preserves the error message, but demotes it back to a notice.

set_error_handler(function($errno, $error){
    if (!str_starts_with($error, 'Undefined array key')){

The voting was wrong. Even when 51% prefer to mess up their code, it's not fair nor necessary to force the rest of us to do the same. We have read all your reasons, but we are still pretty sure you are wrong.

There are many brilliant developers who love PHP because you can write things as easy as:

```
if($arr['user']['name']) {
}
```

It's perfectly ok to assume that an undefined key and any sub-element will return NULL or any other value that casts to FALSE without throwing a WARNING. If we would care about the value, we would explicitly use isset().
We are not afraid about misspelling a key name. It was never a problem for us, but your decission infuriates us.

Thanks for filing this issue.  You are, however mistaken.  It is quite possible to solve the `Ghost Gobble Arcade Game` without the use of conditionals.  Please see the [exemplar solution](https://github.com/exercism/python/blob/main/exercises/concept/ghost-gobble-arcade-game/.meta/exemplar.py) here in the repo for more details.  

We worked very hard to ensure that the `bools` exercise did not require `conditionals` in its solution, since it precedes the `conditionals` exercise.  We also wanted to make sure students really focused in on the Boolean logic. While it is _possible_ to use `if`, `elif` or `else` for the problem (_its entirely your choice_), it is by no means _required_ for a correct solution.

This appears to send the number of days since install, as well as a unique identifier (`getUserAndroidId`), to the index server when fetching indices, without respect for the telemetry preference setting.

This is a data leak that allows for a user's travel history to be tracked by the server, as these requests include client IP and a unique tracking identifier, and client IP is coarse (city-level) geolocation. This means the server can see the various cities the given userIosId travels to as the client IP changes over time.

This spyware feature also exists in the iOS version, and fails to respect the user's consent choice there as well.  It seems unlikely that this is an accident.

First of all, connecting to the server is only something that happens during download. OSMAnd is an offline map and downloads happen rarely. For heavy users less than once a month, for many much less than that. Additionally, all such downloads are user-initiated, they have to explicitly press a download button. Nothing that would be useful to build a profile of any specific user.

**Allegations of travel data and such being leaked are thus really not in evidence.**

The data that is being shared is not possible to connect to any personally identifying information. Notice that google explains that since some 5 years the `getUserAndroidId` is unique per installed application. So any other application the user uses (on the same phone, or not) will not share the UUID. So on top of the fact that not much of a profile can be made at all, there is no way to connect such to any actual personal info.

Does anyone actually have any real issues with the existing code?

A user's travel history often uniquely identifies a person.  The list of client ips and timestamps is the ""actual personal info"".

Common sense is not co-opting the user's device to transmit tracking identifiers without their advance knowledge and opt-in consent. ",False,0
No setting to disable: download sends unique user tracking UUID & number of days since install,vshcherb,1336452733,10,1214327968,0,"I think there are 2 direction of discussions: consent and identification.
1. I don't think consent is needed, same as you don't need consent that your IP is used to download maps. Second it's not a website where you read information, here you use resources, so in that sense by downloading data you agree to fair use of resources (Terms of Service) and in that case you agree that you don't download too many resources especially if you are not paid user for example

It would be completely different case if program would send statistics in background that you're using the application and here is an IP. 

To summarize: it's probably needs to be more clarified in Terms of Service but it doesn't require a consent.

2. User identification. We switched from IP to UUID to calculate how many active users & how often update exactly to solve the server load issue and don't use personal data. For example we don't require email to identify user and don't track IP exactly cause IP could provide location specific information. Random UUID **doesn't identify anything**  if it's not connected to any other services or other private information. We don't share UUID with any other applications so they also couldn't track that UUID even if these apps have personal information.

It's completely incorrect to say that  app could view **travel history**, I would say it's total nonsense cause the server only views what and when maps were downloaded in contrast of other apps that provide Internet services. 

-----------------
Last but not least.

The websites require to ask consent only for information they gather for example if you search an address on website and website doesn't store these addresses or don't connect them to IP (address is essentially publicly available information), consent is not needed. If the website will start storing information in the table [IP, Search], then consent is needed. So it's all about how the data is processed and used and not only what's being transmitted.

Maybe the problem lies that nobody explained in technical details what it means for OSMAnd to be an offline map.

It means that the application, when started, does not cause any network traffic at all. You can travel and use the map daily, including searches for point-of-interests and doing routing, without ever causing a single download. Without, specifically, leaking that uuid.

OSMAnd, in other words, is perfectly useful and allows people to use the app for months or years without ever triggering the download you have noticed sends an UUID. People can download all their data at home or at work, regardless of where they travel later.

I think one thing we could do, though, is possibly stage balance proposals and offer an in-game option to download and apply testing balance mods when hosting a game.

I could see offering 3 balance options when hosting a game:
- **Default balance**
   - This would be the version shipped with that copy of WZ
- **Development balance** (next release)
   - This would correspond to what's merged in the master branch of WZ (and thus what's already staged for the next stable release)
- **Experimental balance**
   - This would correspond to balance changes that _have not yet been merged_, and are under discussion and/or need testing.

To handle possible ramifications of other game engine changes, we might limit Development and Experimental balance to being prepared for the current stable release. (As in: they would be enabled as options as long as you are running the latest stable version of WZ. Otherwise, if you're running an old version, you're stuck with Default balance - as is currently the case - unless you manually use a mod.)

Having these options in-game would really expand the ease of testing balance changes, and make it clear what's just proposals and what's actually planned for the next release.

As I've said, in MAS those are just unused files. If they have a meaning for you, why are they there? Move them somewhere. You don't store sensitive files in directories of other programs? The program directory is the place where the program may add, modify, and remove files. If you don't like it - move the files out.

There's nothing ""reckless,"" no need to make it sound dramatic. We're removing those files the same way we delete `monika.chr`, various `.gift` files, and even the actually **important** and **unreplaceable** `monika` file, as well as other files.

Generally speaking, 
- when you're installing a DDLC mod, don't you already expect it to modify the DDLC directory, as well as to change the mechanics of the base game
- you're installing a Monika-related mod, but somehow surprised that this mod doesn't care about dull files of other game characters. If a Sayori/Yuri/Natsuki -related mod removed `.chr` files, I wouldn't see anything bad in it, be it also for utility purposes or for some lore

At the same time, nobody made Monika to ""recklessly"" delete the other characters in this mod, she did it in the base game. Here we just called a utility function to clean up disk space and make folder structure more clear. Monika doesn't acknowledge this, not doing it herself through her console. There won't be a question to the player because Monika doesn't do this.

> I've already seen several backlash against it

I don't think ""several"" applies to a single person. And even if there were ""several"" people, there's ""multiple"" that aren't against and ""multiple"" that had problems caused by `.chr` files.

Or can the mod just do that instead? So they don't get deleted without notice. Then no need to give notice or choice to the player.

|    Q        |   A
|------------ | ------
| BC Break    | yes
| Version     | 2.14.2

#### Summary

YES I UNDERSTAND that the relied upon feature (short namespace alias) is deprecated BUT upgrading in a MINOR release from 2.14.1 to 2.14.2 should not break an app that was working fine in 2.14.1 - that goes against SEMVER

#### Previous behavior

No error messages when using doctrine/orm 2.14.1 

#### Current behavior

after composer update to doctrine/orm 2.14.2 from 2.14.1 - a minor release, now getting app crashes due to relying on deprecated features (I know I know) 

This is caused by now throwing Exceptions where no exceptions were previously thrown (because of a bug) https://github.com/doctrine/orm/pull/10489

A solution for you personally can be to downgrade to `doctrine/persistence` 2, and address the issue when you have the time.

OK, there were no error messages, but was it working? I believe it either didn't, or worked by accident. If you were using persistence 3 at the time, then you were not using short aliases.

DateTimeImmutable::createFromFormat parses non-existing timezone offsets,dbertovi,1687989535,1,1687989535,0,"### Description

The following code:

```php
<?php
//OK Example:
$time = '2023-02-22 19:44:42.85857+05:30';
$date = DateTimeImmutable::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s.uP', $time);
echo $date->format('P');
//OUTPUT = +05:30 //OK

//BUG Example:
$time = '2023-02-22 19:44:42.127801-110';
$date = DateTimeImmutable::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s.uP', $time);
echo $date->format('P');
//OUTPUT = -01:10 //NOT OK, TIMEZONE OFFSET DOESN'T EXIST, must throw an exception
```

But I expected this output instead:

DateTimeImmutable::createFromFormat parses non-existing timezone offsets,iluuu1994,1687989535,2,1527255788,0,I'm guessing this is by-design. If you specify an offset you should know what you're doing. @derickr Can you confirm/deny?,False,Irony
DateTimeImmutable::createFromFormat parses non-existing timezone offsets,dbertovi,1687989535,3,1527312982,0,"I'm guessing not, but am open to that. Actually, completely other thing that I was doing lead me to this ambiguity. So for example, this function works like charm:
```php
<?php
function getIsDaylightSaving($zoneid = 'America/Los_Angeles') {
    
    try {

        $date = new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone($zoneid));
        return $date->format('I');
        
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        
        return 400;
        
    }
    
}
```
So if one try to do following:
```php
<?php
//get daylight saving time status from timezone identifier, 
$dst = getIsDaylightSaving('America/New_York');
//OUTPUT = 1 //which is OK

//but if I use foo timezone identifier like (this one differs built in IANA timezone db):
$dst = getIsDaylightSaving('ABBA/Mama_Mia');
//The instance new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone($zoneid)); will throw an exception which will be caught in this function
//so the OUTPUT will be 400 //which is also OK.
```
So my point is that I was surprised that PHP didn't care about timezone offsets, but do care about timezone identifiers, since timezone offsets are only the following: 
```php
<?php
$offsets = array('+00:00', '+01:00', '+02:00', '+03:00', '+03:30', '+04:00', '+04:30', '+05:00', '+05:30', '+05:45', '+06:00', '+06:30', '+07:00', '+08:00', '+08:45', '+09:00', '+09:30', '+10:00', '+10:30', '+11:00', '+12:00', '+12:45', '+13:00', '+14:00', '-01:00', '-02:00', '-02:30', '-03:00', '-04:00', '-05:00', '-06:00', '-07:00', '-08:00', '-09:00', '-09:30', '-10:00', '-11:00', '-12:00');
```
For that reason, I think it is a bug, or even some unfinished job. Anyway. I 'dodged a bullet' simply by checking for the offset myself. Everything else is explained in my first comment (i.e., _$time_ variables are expected user input variables).
Hope it helps.

What is this comment? Some kind of words game? Joke? That I am not into? Apropos what is human-friendly, or not, all those values can be a device snapshot. Some distant device snapshot having an application installed on it, that is programmed by a distant developer on certain distant operating system, with some distant programming language, that a developer will use, through his application, to fetch certain data... Now, that developer can be a professional, but can also be not-professional. And now going deeper in that story that here is being presented to my report is pure game of words as this answer is. Yada yada yada ... Please don't waste my time or yours on unconstructive comments.

That is not a topic here. Anyone's programming tasks, styles or stuff like that is not a topic here. 

My point is that a PHP allows -01:10 value where it shouldn't. The end. Schluss. Ende. And that is all. And I didn't expect it to do so, to my surprise, though I use PHP on a daily basis since it's version 3.
