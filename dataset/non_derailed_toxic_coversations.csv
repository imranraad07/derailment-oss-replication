For example, if I have documents A and B where document B has an embedded document, E, I can design the mapping as follows:

``` php
/** @Document */
class A {
    /** @ReferenceMany(targetDocument=""B"", mappedBy=""foo.bar"") */
    private $whatever = [];
}

/** @Document */
class B {
    /** @EmbedMany(targetDocument=""E"") */
    private $foo = [];
}

/** @EmbeddedDocument */
class E {
     /** @ReferenceOne(targetDocument=""A"", inversedBy=""whatever"") */
    private $bar;
}
```

However, reading A::$whatever generates the following notice:

> Notice: Undefined index: foo.bar in mongodb-odm/lib/Doctrine/ODM/MongoDB/Persisters/DocumentPersister.php on line 709

Despite this, the document collection is retrieved correctly.

OSX is the outlier, and it's because of the combinatorial explosions of configuration options, along with the fact that Apple has decided to deliver xcode (and xcode update) configurations that are hostile to developers maintaining non-trivial C extensions.

I'm not sure what outcome you're hoping to achieve with an approach like the above -- rude, disrespectful, entitled -- but watch and hopefully learn as I treat you with more respect than you've treated Nokogiri maintainers.

We believe at this point that the installation tutorial:

```
http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html
```

works for nearly all known configurations of OSX. Did you go through the tutorial and follow all the steps for OSX? If so, that would be useful information to note when opening a support request. If not, help me understand how we can better point people like you at that tutorial? In particular, the xcode bit is really required for Mac users at this point.

If the tutorial doesn't address the problem you're having, then please make sure you provide both the output from `gem install` and also the `mkmf.log` file.

I'll further note that above, you've tried to install three different versions of Nokogiri. I'll also point out that you've got permissions errors even when you sudo, which makes me think you've either got a really weirdly configured system, or else you're trolling.

---

I'd like to note that the Nokogiri Code of Conduct

```
https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
```

asks everyone to be nice and reminds you that Nokogiri maintainers are volunteers, who don't get paid to work on it, and have personal lives and families. Your approach in this issue is offensive and rude, and in all honesty represents most of what I dislike about being an open source maintainer. You expect something for nothing, and heap abuse on volunteers who have spent hundreds of thankless hours working to get Nokogiri to work on OSX.

If you've surmounted your personal communication and anger-management challenges and read this far, I'll ask that if you go through the installation tutorial and it doesn't address the problem you're having, that you open a new issue and respectfully provide enough information to help a maintainer diagnose the issue on your particular system.

I'll be locking this issue both because your request violates the CoC, but also just to preserve Yet Another Disrespectful Request for posterity, and so that when I finally get fed up and ragequit open source, I'll have plenty of interesting Github Issues to point people at.

Finally -- everyone in the Ruby community who saw this issue come in and didn't do anything to police it -- you're part of the problem, too. For every open-source maintainer who quits, y'all wring your hands and are full of regret; but these are the opportunities you miss to prevent that from happening. A community that doesn't police rudeness and disrepect is not a community I'm happy to be a part of.

---

@SUzB - sorry you got caught in the crossfire on this, but you've also made a very unconstructive post wherein the OP claims a problem and shows three very different logs for three different versions of Nokogiri, and you say, ""I am facing the same issue."" No, no you're not.

Please feel free to open a new issue providing enough information for us to diagnose your issue. At the very least, info about your OS, and if you're OSX then we'll need to know more about xcode and will need to see your logs.

Bug

**What is the current behavior?**
If I run .save on a mongoose schema without being connected to the database, the callback is never called. I don't get any errors either. The process seems to be running forever. Also, if I'd run an empty .save(), `message.save()` before the actual save, I get the 200 response back. Not sure if that's the expected behaviour or not.

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
Controller:
```
    var message = new Message({
        content: ""Much content""
    });
});

    // message.save(); <--- run this to get the 200 response
    message.save(function (err) {
        if (err){
            console.log('Something went wrong: ' + err);
            return res.status(500).send(""Something went wrong: "" + err);
        }
        return res.status(200).send(""Saved!"");
    });

```
Model:
```
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;
// Schema.set('validateBeforeSave', false); // to validate data manually

//mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/userFeedback'); <--- don't connect to database
mongoose.set('debug', true);

var MessageSchema = new Schema({
    content: String
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Message', MessageSchema);

Could be a mismatch between kernel and userland ABI:
In case you upgraded from a way older version (=didn't `emerge zfs` for quite some time) you still might have the old userland binaries somewhere in your path, their location changed a while ago.
Similar problem (when you can only locate the new version in your path) could happen when the old kernel module is still loaded but the new version of the userland is used.

About zfs binary stopped working I know, it is because I compiled a new version of zfs and still use old version of zfs-kmod.

I read this link about grsecurity, but didn't found a solution. Also, I don't see any grsecurity errors at dmesg while compiling. 

So now I have new zfs and old zfs-kmod and I am afraid to reboot, I don't know how to compile the same version in gentoo or back-forward for some commits.

Since this begs finally some proper attention, I will describe this issue (feel free to remove the comment later as you obviously are seemingly easily to have your feelings hurt regardless of whether the other person intended so or not...).

I'll just clarify a few things: I've never asked for help in the channel and treated someone ""poorly"". I responded ironically to ptx0's messages, after he spent the past few hours being dismissive or condescending to other people, obviously in some cases users with a very limited skill around ZFS, but that does not merit acting like an imbecile. None of them were insults or hostile, they simply pointed out that ptx0 was assuming things constantly and then replying with an air of arrogance and usually in a condescending tone, despite himself being far from a beacon of excellence as far as technical skill or coding go. Immediately after he proceeded to ban me from the channel, to which I responded in -social pointing out that his attitude and actions making him look puerile and petty regardless of the nature of the ""offense"" by someone else. This knee-jerk reaction came motivated more by petty personal sentiments (and sharing those with some others who, well, fit that profile) than any actually reasonable reasons.

Now, on the project: you are routinely accepting patches quite obviously without really doing your due diligence, ensuring proper QA, etc. Case in point, the one we have here. It's painful to see that you waste more time on petty nothings over actually making your code or merged patches look like something with a modicum of technical quality. The control over whether contributors are just copy-pasting from other spots (*hint* licensing violations get people sued), if the patches actually conflict with major kernel features, or symbol exports, or..... is lacking all over the place.

How about instead of making up half-truths about people offending your feelings, or your buddies' feelings, you go and properly benefit from the resources you so adamantly defend (and ask others to work with): How difficult was it to grab the patch I sent you from the link, test it, test it again, sign it off and merge it? You need to go around deleting comments and engaging in conversation with the other troll, but you are too busy to actually merge an out of band patch while you waste time over petty fights? Well, good luck with that. And you are surprised ZoL is not taken seriously anywhere but by the homelab/non-enterprise crowd. If you want to be a primadonna, at least have the cards in your sleeve to back it up: you can't justify it right now with the standard you are providing your users.

what can I do if my templates are broken or something else in the asset pipe is missing?

I override some CSS things, imported it in the scss files and then i was figuring out how to get those assets in the system, i did following a few times:

RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:clean
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile

Then I also changed the logo on my pod (diaspora/app/assets/branding/logos)

First thing which come up was that the branding/logos/asterisk_white_mobile.png was not found, but it was there, i changed something on templates and could not remember, so i put the original back in.

What refreshing has always done in this and other buffers is to update to reflect the situation in the local repository.  *That* is what most users would expect and to instead perform a destructive operation would be very surprising and dangerous.

It doesn't do anything destructive in the remote repository. It
synchronizes your *local* refs with the remote refs, taking *remote*
as the source of truth, and updating the local to reflect it.  Thus,
it doesn't do any destructive changes at all, neither locally nor
remotely.  The functionality of Git is just wrong when it does a
fetch, it should've also fetched the refs, but... it doesn't.  And I'm
just too tired of Git's boolshit to try to fight it.

Think about this operation as cache invalidation, all it does is it
instructs to invalidate the local cache of remote refs, which it
should've been doing by default anyways.

It can be because of a translation patch, an SRAM patch, and so on...

So I suggest a very simple solution :

Just add an option in playlist menu that could be named '_Ignore CRC while scanning roms_' or '_Add unknown roms to playlists_', whatever.

The thing is that it'll replace that line

`""crc32"": XXXXXXXX | crc""`

By

`DETECT`

In order to easily display all roms on playlists, with a label **taken from rom filenames**, so that roms with a good labels would display thumbnails, and roms with another label (like T-eng 100% etc...) would not display cover (it's not a big deal).

RetroArch playlists are painful to use because of those unique CRC32, and it would be wonderful to simplify it in that way !


For now, I'm creating my Playlists with _RetroArch Playlists Manager_ on Windows, to add my SRAM patched GBA roms, as well as all my non-detected translated roms.

Thanks for reading, I really hope to see that option.

For the packs or on-demand downloads (https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/pull/8490) forcing filename is fine I guess.

That way on both GUIs we could have an option to link a thumbnail that is not on the thumbnails folder or isn't part of the packs.

The whole al filenames have to match convention was due to the fact that the playlist couldn't grow or store any more information because the format was hardcoded.

The new one has room to grow.

As for the OP.
I figure we could have an option that reads ""Add to playlist"" then you select a file and it would search the DBs for occurrences with that name, then the user would be able to select the best suited entry. 

Of course that's a lot more complex than it sounds

Why not, but it'd be a hundred time longer than manually creating playlists on a PC.

CRCs are already ignored when scanning many many roms types - for serials. Among other things this means that contributing to the libretro-database romhacks CRCs is completely useless¹ and is most of the reason i'm hesitating to continue after contributing quite a lot and creating a tool to auto update my PRs and hacks.

If anything what i want is the exact opposite of this feature: give a option to ignore the serials and go full crc instead of pretending that a serial is a unique id (hilariously, even if you scan something like a snes rom, you get all of its 'versions' and 'dump variants' - and maybe even hacks don't even remember but it may be worse and they simply not be there). 

This is hardly unique, since console makers didn't really care often about editions or bugfixes bumping serials, though as i mentioned it gets kafkaesque once hacks come into the picture. I made plenty of suggestions to both make a CRC scanner faster (only do it optionally, only do it for (cd) formats with a inbuilt crc like chd, keep a separate hack database and only check when needed, keep the crcs of cue files for the 'canonical' dump sets etc).  The RA project made it clear that the scanner is a afterthought with a rather impressive number of ways it can go wrong and no interest in doing anything to get data the original dump sets didn't provide (filtering mame split sets for only the main 'rom' for instance) so i stopped caring.


¹ in fact i'm about 95% suure that last time i checked, the 'crc' on the playlist files was often bogus now, and a artifact of the old format / code using crcs but the scanner changing to serial as primary key, so you have crcs being 'found' that are completely fictitious.",False,0,CONTRIBUTOR

So no, i'm not going to do your features for you. I just thought it especially precious that people are so misinformed about this that they think CRCs are the 'problem that needs to be solved' when the scanner is a dumpster fire in many other ways because it abandoned unique keys or because there isn't a option to make the scanner stop trying to support everything under the sun and be bad at everything.

I'm not even opposed to fast scan of serials myself, only not when the 'serial' has a obvious other entry in the same database with a different crc. In that case, yes, i'd love the option to 'if it isn't a unique key, fallback to CRC plz'.",False,Bitter frustration,CONTRIBUTOR

The reason we're dropping negative padding is not because we want to break your app (of course!) but because we couldn't implement a consistent and predictable behavior for that feature.
We understand that some previous versions of kaminari were luckily working on your app as you expected, but that same app may behave differently on a different setup. We don't want to ship such a fragile thing as our public API.

Kaminari is an abstraction layer for those who don't want to calculate and manipulate complex pagination logic. Or maybe we can call it a DSL.
We believe that a library for such purpose should never include something that behaves unpredictably. That is why we're carefully testing our code base against multiple versions of ruby, rails, and multiple kinds of database engines.

There are reasons behind APIs. And the reasons are written in the tests (and commit comments / discussions). We maintain tests so that we can make sure we're properly providing what we've designed.
So, when you're proposing to change an existing behavior, you will need to reflect your new design in the tests and make them all green for all test matrix.

There are many problems in the ``states.mount.mounted`` code path, e.g. the mount command arguments are not quoted in the ``modules.mount.mount`` function, see 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/mount.py#L1237. 

Code should look like this IMO:
```
cmd = 'mount {0} {1} {2} '.format(args, device, shlex.quote(name))
```
But this will fix only a small piece of the whole problem.

Another one is that ``states.mount.mounted`` does not detect correctly that the filesystem might be mounted already, i think it's because the key in the active table is not unquoted, so a comparison between
``/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My\040Passport\040Blue`` and the specified ``/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My Passport Blue`` fails.

To me it looks like the whole mount state and module is not able to handle blanks in device names and mount points properly.

I am trying to build myself home NAS with old Atom mini-ITX board... So i install OMV5, i plug in dad's old NTFS drive... and here we go...

Frankly, i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. So any hacker which for whatever reason would change it - would be instantly notifie on old pending bugs.

Salt seems extremely fragile here, probably no one else except for OMV5 uses it for partitions. Maybe OMV6 could do it outside Salt? Like good old UDEV rules or anything. I mean, before Salt porject might decide to drop this functionality that almost no one use, instead of burden of maintaining it for OMV5 alone....

Well, ranting aside, i am rather puzzled with your _device: ""/dev/disk/by-label/My\\x20Passport\\x20Blue""_
Where do you even get this hex substitution from???

Thing is, the whole mounting escaping is one uber-ancient legacy mess. Putting it here so maybe someone would use it. I spent like 3 hours googling around and experimenting with Python that i never used before. Tryied to google some standard about Posix/Linux/bash filename mangling/escaping.... and then Python module to undo it. To no avail.

Okay, so, to document it down.

- mtab/fstab and friends is one-of-a-kind ancient mess.
- it started with ancient BSD (not FreeBSD) function strunvis, which behaviour  not documented. Probably that was OS-specific function (a la virtual methods). http://manpages.org/strunvis/3
- when Linux was mimicking good old BSd it only made ad hoc substitutions for 4 specific chars. There is no any systematic/generic pattern at all.

```
static inline void mangle(struct seq_file *m, const char *s)
{
	seq_escape(m, s, "" \t\n\\"");
}
```

```

				R(""011"", '\t'),
				R(""012"", '\n'),
				R(""040"", ' '),
				R(""134"", '\\')
```
https://sources.debian.org/src/sysvinit/2.96-6/src/fstab-decode.c/

So, whatever comes from Linux mounts information - should be de-mangled for those four special cases.
Every single space-separated column of every single line.
Ugly, and undocumented, but that is what it is. And, frankly, it is not that hard...

BUT, why do you want to compare with some arbitrary hex-escaped string? what can be a real use-case for that???
Linux kernel just does not have hex-escaping code for disk mounts.

Now, to be frank, even this would NOT be enough, because i can have multiple disks with the same partition label. Like many USB thumb drives with ""DATA"" partition. I can even have several partitions with the same name on singe disk!

Again, it can be fixed by detecting collisions and adding extra data, like counters or GUID or whatever, but...

What gonna OMV do if OMV's user has two drives with partitions having same labels, and then he hotplugs one disk, or another, or both in any order? Is it race condition now? Is it okay for OMV to have race condition?

And similar code inside `def _resolve_user_group_names(opts):`

So it seems Salt prefers to keep space-containing names mangled, but mangled differently.
So, no escaping when calling `mount` or `umount` is needed,

---

I am not even sure that de-escaping mount point likes `xxx\040yyy` in Salt would be correct way to go.

There can be a point: since that module serves as abstraction layer and should hide UNIX-likes peculiarities from generic Salt modules, all IDs better be unmangled. But not sure. 

However IF to do this de-mangling, then quoting arguments for calling `mount` becomes required indeed.

But anyway, this line i believe  should not had ended in /etc/fstab and whoever added it was at fault...

Would you keep implementation non-patched and would you call `salt-call mount.list_mounts` - you would see the mount point broken, cut off on the first space. This was probably THE bug.

So, it is UDEV or SYSTEMD which creates those weird hex-mangled names. Okay. Though putting them into /etc/fstab still feels wrong. `man mount` suggests against it and suggests using `UUID=...` and `LABEL=...` flags instead.

Now back to your
```
Example SLS:

mount_fs_with_label:
  mount.mounted:
    - name: ""/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My Passport Blue""
```

I don't know what it should mean in specific files/commands terms. But i feel this is the error on OMV part. And perhaps lack of documentation/understanding/forecasting on Salt part.

```
def mount(
    name, device=False, mkmnt=False, fstype="""", opts=""defaults"", user=None, util=""mount""
):
.....
        salt '*' mount.mount /mnt/foo /dev/sdz1 True
.....
    if device:
        cmd += ""{} {} {} "".format(args, device, name)
    else:
        cmd += ""{} "".format(name)
```

My inner archeologist says that the `name` AKA mount point AKA target directory is meant to be in bash-mangled format.
IOW OMV should had created ""\ "" containing fileneames:
```
  mount.mounted:
    - name: ""/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My\ Passport\ Blue""
```
Linux `man mount` also suggests against the second option due to ambiguity, where the single parameter is mount point name or device file name. I don't know if other UNIX-likes but Linux support those precision keys.

```
       --source device
              If only one argument for the mount command is given  then  the
              argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source
              (device).  This option allows to explicitly  define  that  the
              argument is the mount source.

       --target directory
              If  only  one argument for the mount command is given then the
              argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source
              (device).   This  option  allows to explicitly define that the
              argument is the mount target.
```

So i think that part in `def mount` should better be written as

```
    if device:
        cmd += ""{} {} {} "".format(args, device, name)
    else:
        if __grains__[""kernel""] == ""Linux"":
             cmd += ""--target ""
        cmd += ""{} "".format(name)

Escaping blanks is not my idea, it is used by every userland command that processes mount points, e.g. `mount`.
Either `systemd` want to have escaped paths in mount units too, there is a special command to convert
paths for you, see `systemd-escape`.

OMV already workarounds this issue, thus it is not affected by this reported issue here.

I don't think Salt will drop `mount.mounted` because it is a somewhat essential functionality of Linux systems.

You can do that, but don't blame the software then. Using USB devices in a NAS is no good idea, but that's a different thing. IMO devices using in a NAS should be already connected to the NAS, no plug-and-play, this is not how a NAS is intended to work. If devices are always connected, then you will never run into the situation that duplicate labels might harm your system. This issue is user introduced and should be handled by them.

by failing to mount the disk? because i can not mount disk in OMV5 or i would never learn about this issue.
failing to mount disk does not look like work-around at all.

let's think what we can do to make space-containing partitions mounted by OMV. It seems to be a kind of ""communication breakdown"" between Salt and OMV5, they expect and provide for mututally incompatible things.

You still try to push Salt to adhere to OMV data format, while common sense says it should be otherwise.

Salt users would not suffer from it. OMV users would.
Demanding PR from OMV users like me is funny when you did not make any PR to Salt, or maybe i am wrong and you did.

So, back to:

https://github.com/openmediavault/openmediavault/issues/566#issuecomment-809541057

Without forcing them to go ssh sudo. 
So simple.

Because that woul be consistent with bash/Salt data format. But i alreeady said it was kneejerk impulse, so you eems to be crashing through door wide open.

Some we are on the same page here. You blaze of ego is called for.

Since eysterday i was asking you to show me at the se
ems between OMV and Salt, the exact borderleines, didn't i?
I am glad you seem to did so above, https://github.com/openmediavault/openmediavault/issues/566#issuecomment-809529126

And when i showed those links, i commented upon them.

`Salt is based on Python, not PHP. The code you're ranting about never runs in the Salt context.`

I never said so. Both Salt and OMV are ""black boxes"" with some data exchange. And i was asking you to point me to the raw places of exchange and raw data being exchanged, didn't i?

Yesterday i spent hours looking into Salt code and patching it along your suggestions.
First i took your suggestions as correct and thought through. And just followed them. An then had to undo it all.

Now you imply it was your time wasted not mine.

That `Example SLS:` - many times from yesterday i asked you how can i reproduice this activity from bash command line.
For example above - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/54508#issuecomment-808875885
You kind of answered by showing PHP code for SLS generation - after many requests and hours.
But you still not answered how to trigger that action from bash.

I asked you yesterday how to make OMV code trigger that action of Salt, allegedly buggy Salt.
And you refused to help me doing it.

What can i patch in OMV5 to make this notification gone?
Why do you want to know that? What do you expect to improve?

Thank you for your response all duly noted. I would like to put my point
of view whilst accepting that you can run your team and policy exactly
as you wish. For me I have to decide whether or not to join in. I am a
software developer with around 50 years of experience in small and large
projects. I am currently working on a secure email system which will
have a radius server as part of its back office services. For me, I
thought we had started a dialogue with my first problem, I acted on your
advice, reloaded linux, installed myql, tried to build freeradius and
there was a different kind of failure. In my view a failure of this kind
is usually a failure in the software, either configuration or build. As
such it was right to refer it back to the development team rather than
post to a users mailing list. I will not be doing this. I will fix the
problem myself or go to a different package. 

I will detach now. 

Best wishes with your excellent freeradius which I first found out about
in the O'Reilly book ""RADIUS"". 

Now on with my life.

| Version     | 2.10

#### Summary

Some changes in 2.10 make a BC break. On line 281 in OCI8Statement, the column is not valid in array, so throws a Notice: Undefined index: test.

Before upgrade to 2.10 the line looks like:
`$column = $this->_paramMap[$column] ?? $column;`

After upgrade do 2.10 is:
`$column = $this->_paramMap[$column];`

#### Current behaviour

Undefined index in array. The null coalesce operator was removed (WHY, who accept this ?)

#### How to reproduce

The EntityManager must be of OCI8 instance.

```
$query = $this->entityManager->getConnection()->prepare($prepareSQL);
$query->bindValue('test', 'testvalue');
$query->execute();
```

#### Expected behaviour

Should be work by using default column.

We cannot have those absolutely disgusting  derogatory words in our codebase. Therefore, we need to change them to race-neutral words.

There are more references to racial supremacy throughout the code. These should be discussed.

Should this macro be renamed to `skip_blankspace`?
https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/module/nvpair/nvpair.c#L46

Also, in the Lua module, we mark objects as ""wh\*te"" or ""b\*ack"". I suggest changing the colors to some non-offensive ones. I propose indigo (`#4B0082`) and forest green (`#228B22`).
https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/module/lua/lgc.c

### Motivation and Context
Following other open-source projects, we should strive to keep the ZFS code base clean of any vulgar, racist or other unnecessary remarks and to allow for friendly and welcoming environment for people of all kinds.

### How Has This Been Tested?
It compiles - it's just basic refactoring.

It is criticized that the term ""master"" might have a negative connotation for people who were directly or indirectly affected by slavery. 

I think that especially in the light of the fact that the Rust Community is known for its openness towards all ethics and minorities, serious consideration should be given to renaming the master branch correspondingly. The GitHub CEO himself has already expressed his support for the idea (see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1271253144442253312?s=19)), and the official GitHub cli repository has also already been changed accordingly.

I've imported my rides from Garmin Connect to add power estimates and I've noticed that the normalised Power is often well overstated, the average power looks sensible but for example on one ride the avg watts was 157 and the normalised was 262, this is massively overstated I'd expect maybe 165 to 170.  I can provide the TCX file if it helps.

Many Thanks,

Ralph.

- The query must fetch the parent item's BOM if the item variant does not have a BOM.

The whole point of having variant items is that you must create variant BOMs to match. Fetching a BOM linked to a parent template does not make sense at all. The whole point of a template is that *IT DOESN'T EXIST* and that variants of it are *DIFFERENT TO EACH OTHER AND HENCE HAVE DIFFERENT SUBITEMS*

In the gif example, you are making a RED item with a BOM that does not have a colour. So how are you supposed to order, transfer stock and make the item from the RED raw material?

This also completely misses the point that the linked BOM is saved in the Sales Order Item.

I truly give up with this development team. Too many people contributing too many ill-thought out features, badly.
This is just one example of a complete break in logic.

> Additional Q: How to build module documentation as man page?

I'm not sure if you are referring to the CLI or the `docs/` directory. For the CLI, we are using `optparse` from the Python Standard Library. There should be various existing third-party tools which will convert the output of `optparse`'s `--help` to man page(s). I would suggest exploring those options. We currently use MkDocs to render the content of the `docs/` directory to HTML. Last I knew, no-one has made a MkDocs plugin which outputs man pages and I could care less about doing so.

Once `main` is added to `package.json` linting passes.

The fixer for the missing parentheses sniff adds the parentheses to the wrong place for a particular statement.

## Minimal Code Snippet
```php
$this->current_provider = new $this->providers->{$this->current_provider_slug}['provider'];
```

The issue happens when running this command:
```bash
phpcs phpcs-test.php --standard=WordPress-Extra -sp --basepath=.
```

... over a file containing this code (minimal example, extracted from the real code):
```php
<?php
$this->current_provider = new $this->providers->{$this->current_provider_slug}['provider'];
```

<!-- For bugs with fixers: How was the code fixed? How did you expect the code to be fixed? -->

The file was auto-fixed via `phpcbf` to:
```php
<?php
$this->current_provider = new $this->providers->(){$this->current_provider_slug}['provider'];
// ---------------------------------------------^ ❌ 
```


... while I expected the code to be fixed to:
```php
<?php
$this->current_provider = new $this->providers->{$this->current_provider_slug}['provider']();
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^ ✅  
```

## Error Code

## Environment

2. change into the src of your project folder
```
cd src
```

3. run 
```
nest generate module tasks

Hi @Portisch - without going into a he says/she says… I can categorically state that the code I submitted is my own. 

It has been on my work list for a long time; in my branch, mailing lists, logs, and in the forum, in this issue and the PR. Every bump of samba has had me looking at it again. In terms of your quoted comment - actually it is not the reason for the issue - the samba compile is not done as an “Active Directory Domain Controller”. Though you are right - that the answer was staring us all in the face… “samba-dcerpcd”

I can share the details on my working (straces/logs/…) - the lights on moment with discovery of the solution was firstly the /tmp/srvsvc in the log which did send me to read the change log again. But just adding samba-dcerpcd into the compile list = no success…. sbin - no success, then local_np.c: dyn_SAMBA_LIBEXECDIR via strings on the /usr/lib/…

So whilst timing is a coincidence - I reiterate - my work is original.

I go out of my way to ensure that attribution is correct, and update the authorship from myself to the author when it is not from me or co-authored. I have worked with @vpeter4 on PRs previously and hope to continue doing so. I do not and would not blatantly rip other peoples code off. Have a look at my branches if you need to validate my statement.

I would appreciate your confirmation and understanding that the submissions of these PRs are coincidence. 

Note: I don’t have a watch on the coreelec or other downstream repos; so was unaware of the submission until ray commented on my PR.

@vpeter4 - I would be very happy for you to submit your PR to upstream (instead of mine) yours was first after all :-) ",False,0,CONTRIBUTOR

to not complain about love not being defined. And not complain about everything defined in other files as undefined global.

### Actual Behaviour

Everything work just fine as expected before yesterday when i updated my system. Now i have almost as many errors as lines in my files everything is an undefined global.

Description:
This is an easily re-producible bug that is consistent across new and old installations of Laravel 8 & 9. It was already reported, and has been a bug in Laravel for over a year. @driesvints couldn't be bothered to investigate, so closed the issue.

Write a test that reads or writes this field

@driesvints In my previous ticket, I reported this as Laravel 8 forgetting Laravel 9 exists. I'm using Laravel 9. The same bug exists. If you waste more of my time, I'll bill you. You've been handed the exact lines of code responsible for this, and that obviously hasn't changed.

When I enter a command, that returns an error, the line with that command is marked with a green arrow.
The next line, valid or not, gets marked red, which is confusing, since it was valid in my case.

### Steps to reproduce

Example: Installing something via apt without using sudo:

❯ apt-get install mosh
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?
❯ sudo apt-get install mosh
[sudo] password for user:

The first line has a green arrow, while the thirds one is red.

### Expected behavior

Color the arrow red where the command actually failed.

At the beginning, you got your indicator, if a command returned with 0 or not. However, it is not related to the command right next to it.

I know what you mean, since of course you have the return value AFTER a command or programm finished executing, so it gives you feedback after something has completed (successfully or not).

@Gandalf1783 Given your lack of response, I'm assuming you just wanted to gaslight someone (me in this case) without any actual knowledge of the problem?  You just wanted to sound like you knew more than someone else without knowing anything at all?

No program has enough knowledge (currently) to pull off what you think is trivial.

The terminal doesn't know the purpose of the text it displays, it can't do it.

zsh/omz/p10k doesn't know what happens in-between the prompts.  They can control what is displayed on the current prompt lines.   They can query where on the terminal they are, but once another program has run with unknown amount of text output and the screen scrolls, all for that previous knowledge is useless.  Terminal queries for row number only apply to the displayed screen, not relative to the top of the scroll back buffer.  

To be fair, I too was annoyed by this some time ago and solved it for myself by displaying green/red lines across the entire terminal width before the next prompt is displayed.  The color line is the status for everything above the line.  I've left the prompt symbol in, but rarely look it.  Here's an example:

<img width=""363"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15944841/224548171-55aae1cb-8d04-4feb-af7a-20a90993c3ad.png"">

I would like to suggest changing the name or removing the `nextFloat()` method. Now is ideal time before the stable release, then it would be too late of course.

The name `nextFloat()` creates the expectation that it will return some other number in the generated series. See, for example, the following code:

```php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();
$a = $randomizer->getFloat(100, 200); // number between 100..200
$b = $randomizer->nextFloat(); // another number between 100..200 ???
```

Do you expect `$b` to be the next number in the interval 100..200? Surprisingly not, the method returns a number in the interval 0..1. 

Honestly, I don't understand the `next` prefix in the method name at all. Its [definition is](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/randomizer_additions#nextfloat):

> This method is equivalent to ->getFloat(0, 1)

That is, a function that returns a number in the interval 0..1 without any relation to anything previous. I therefore find the name completely misleading. A more accurate name would be, for example, `getFloat0To1()`, but I think that `getFloat(0, 1)` is obvious and there is no need to add a new method.",True,0,NONE

But before you do, realize that ""next"" is a rather common term used with random number sequences - as it is, in fact, basically a matter of _sequences_ and not simply conjuring some number out of a hat. That means PHP would actually be joining a club whose members use the word ""next"" when describing their randomness APIs:

* [Python 3's `random.random()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) is documented as ""return[ing] the next random floating point number in the range 0.0 <= X < 1.0"".
* [Java's `java.util.Random` class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html) has similar methods like ""next"", ""nextBoolean"", ""nextBytes"", and so on.
* Unsurprisingly, [Microsoft Java's own `System.Random` class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=net-7.0) has a variety of methods named ""Next"", ""NextBytes"", ""NextDouble"", ""NextInt64"", and so on.
* [Rust's `rand::RngCore` trait](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/trait.RngCore.html), which is its lowest-level ""interface"" for randomness, names its two core methods ""next_u32"" and ""next_u64"".

So with any luck, allow me to offer my congratulations on you learning why the name ""nextFloat"" is not misleading after all.

### Bug description

When trying to watch YouTube videos in the UK ~1/4 of the videos I try and play get stuck ""loading"" / ""buffering"" indefinitely and will never start playing on their own. 
You can work around this buy skipping to the end of the video then using replay to restart playback which will start immediately. You can also use a VPN to load videos while connected to US server. 


### Steps to reproduce

1. Live in the UK / connect to UK VPN server 
2. Try playing multiple videos
3. Video will get stuck loading
